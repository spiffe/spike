## Audit Your Code Before You Submit

Before submitting a pull request run `make audit` and ensure that there are no
issues. Running `make audit` will find issues with the code that would trigger
CI failures and prevent it from being merged.

## How To Run Tests

`make audit` already runs the tests for you; however, running the tests
separately is still useful.

Before merging your changes, make sure all tests pass.

To run the unit tests locally, run `go test ./...` on the project root.
