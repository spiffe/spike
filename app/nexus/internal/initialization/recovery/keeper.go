// TODO: move ShardSize const to SDK so we can refer it from a central location.

// iterateKeepersAndInitializeState retrieves Shamir secret shards from multiple
// SPIKE Keeper instances and attempts to reconstruct the root key when a
// threshold number of shards is collected.
//
// The function iterates through all configured keepers, requesting their shards
// via SPIFFE mTLS. Once the Shamir threshold is reached, it reconstructs the
// root key and initializes the system state. This function implements secure
// memory handling, ensuring sensitive data is cleared after use.
//
// Parameters:
//   - source: An X.509 source for mTLS authentication when communicating with
//     keeper services
//   - successfulKeeperShards: A map storing successfully retrieved shards
//     indexed by keeper ID. Each shard is a fixed-size byte array of size
//     shardSize
//
// Returns:
//   - bool: true if the system was successfully initialized with the
//     reconstructed root key, false if initialization failed or insufficient
//     shards were collected
//
// Security considerations:
//   - All sensitive data (shards, root key) is securely erased from memory
//     after use
//   - The function will fatal log and terminate if keeper IDs cannot be
//     converted to integers
//   - Shards are validated to ensure they are not zeroed before being accepted
//
// The function performs the following steps:
//  1. Iterates through all configured keepers from env.Keepers()
//  2. For each keeper, requests its shard via HTTP using mTLS authentication
//  3. Validates and stores successful shard responses
//  4. When the threshold is reached, reconstructs the root key using Shamir's
//     Secret Sharing
//  5. Initializes the system state with the recovered root key
//  6. Securely clears all sensitive data from memory
