Additionally,\nSPIFFE’s automatic identity rotation and short-lived cryptographic\nidentities enhance security and resilience, making it an ideal foundation\nfor a zero-trust secrets management system.\nWhy Not Use Kubernetes Secrets\nOne of the most misunderstood aspects of Kubernetes secrets is that\nKubernetes secrets are not truly secrets. While Kubernetes provides a\nmechanism to store and manage sensitive information, it is not a dedicated\nsecrets management solution.\nHere’s why relying on Kubernetes secrets can be problematic:\nLimited Scope &amp; Portability\nIf a service outside Kubernetes—or in another cluster—needs access to a\nKubernetes secret, it introduces significant authentication and authorization\nchallenges.\nKubernetes Secrets are designed to work within a single cluster, making it\ndifficult to share them securely across different environments\n(e.g., multiple clusters, bare-metal infrastructure, or cloud-based services).\nThis limitation can lead to inconsistent security policies and fragmented secret\nmanagement practices.\nA robust secrets management strategy should consider secrets’ scope beyond a\nsingle cluster.\nStatic Nature of the Secrets\nKubernetes secrets are static once created. They are stored in etcd and\ninjected into pods at startup, meaning updates require manual\nintervention—modifying the secret, redeploying affected applications, and\nensuring no stale or expired secrets remain in use.\nUpdating a Kubernetes Secret does not automatically notify or reload the\nworkloads consuming it. Applications typically need to be restarted or\nre-deployed to pick up the new secret, adding operational complexity and\npotential downtime if not managed carefully.\nThis lack of flexibility introduces security risks and operational overhead.\nSecurity and Governance Limitations\nKubernetes Secrets are governed by Kubernetes RBAC. Using Kubernetes Secrets, it\ncan be tricky to enforce a platform-agnostic security policy that spans\nmultiple environments. This often leads to fragmented governance and\npotential misconfigurations.\nA dedicated secrets manager offers dynamic cross-environment compatibility\nand stronger security controls—making it a better choice for modern,\ndistributed architectures.\nKubernetes Secrets Are Not Encrypted By Default\nKubernetes Secrets are stored in etcd, and unless encryption at rest is\nexplicitly enabled, they are stored in plaintext. This means that anyone with\naccess to etcd (including certain privileged users or attackers who compromise\nthe cluster) can retrieve sensitive data without needing Kubernetes API access.\nMoreover, even with encryption at rest, the security model of Kubernetes Secrets\nremains weaker than a dedicated secrets store. While encryption prevents direct\nretrieval of plaintext secrets from etcd storage, an attacker with right\nprivileges can get the encryption key. Additionally, the Kubernetes API must\ndecrypt secrets when serving them to workloads, meaning any user or process\nwith sufficient API permissions can still retrieve secrets in plaintext.\nSo not only etcd itself, but also API-layer access is also a risk factor\nin enforcing the security of Kubernetes Secrets.\nWhen Are Kubernetes Secrets Useful?\nDespite these challenges, Kubernetes Secrets can still be useful in simple,\ncluster-contained workloads where:\n\nSecrets do not need frequent rotation.\nAll applications consuming the secrets reside in the same cluster.\nRBAC policies are well-configured to prevent accidental exposure.\n\nHowever, for any multi-cluster, dynamic, or zero-trust architecture, a\ndedicated secrets management solution is a better approach—providing\nfine-grained access control, cross-environment compatibility, and stronger\nsecurity guarantees.\nThat part taken care of, we can get our hands dirty with SPIKE in the\nSPIKE Quickstart Guide.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSPIKE Quickstart Guide\n\n\n\nAbout\nCommunity\nGetting Started\nUsing SPIKE\nDeveloping SPIKE\nSPIKE Architecture\nTracking\nOperations\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/about/intro/","title":"About SPIKE"},"https://spike.ist/about/project-status/":{"body":"Project Maturity\n\nSPIKE is a SPIFFE-affiliated project that has reached Development\nmaturity as defined in the SPIFFE Project Lifecycle.\nThis means:\n\nSPIKE is functionally stable and suitable for broader experimentation and\ncommunity involvement.\nSPIKE is not yet production-ready, and certain features or interfaces may\ncontinue to evolve.\nStability and polish are improving, but users should expect occasional bugs or\nbreaking changes.\n\nWe invite developers and early adopters to explore, test, and contribute.

Token Storage Strategy for SPIKE Nexus\n\n\nStatus: accepted\nDate: 2024-11-03\nTags: Security, Sessions, Memory Management, Scalability\n\nContext\nSPIKE Nexus requires storage of session tokens for admin authentication.\nWe need to evaluate the option of storing these tokens in-memory (as opposed\nto storing them in a database).\nKey considerations:\n\nSPIKE Nexus is primarily used by administrators, not end-users\nSession persistence across server restarts is not a critical requirement\nSecurity is a primary concern for the SPIKE ecosystem\nUser scale is limited (admin-focused tool)\nMemory consumption for session tokens is minimal\n\nDecision\nWe will implement in-memory storage for session tokens in SPIKE Nexus\ninstead of storing them in the database.\nRationale\nWhy In-Memory Storage:\nEnhanced Security\n\nEliminates risks associated with persistent storage\nReduces attack surface by removing database attack vectors\nAutomatic token invalidation on server restart provides a security benefit\nAligns with SPIKE’s security-first approach\n\nPerformance\n\nFaster token validation due to in-memory access\nEliminates encryption/decryption overhead\nReduces database load\n\nSimplicity\n\nSimpler implementation and maintenance\nNo need for token cleanup mechanisms\nReduces complexity in encryption management\n\nScale Considerations\n\nLimited admin users means memory impact is negligible\nSession tokens are small in size\nVertical scaling is sufficient for an admin-focused tool\n\nWhy Not Database Storage\n\nSession persistence across restarts is not a requirement\nAdditional security exposure through the database is unnecessary\nEncryption/decryption overhead is not justified\nDatabase cleanup complexity can be avoided\n\nConsequences\nPositive:\n\nImproved security posture\nSimplified implementation\nBetter performance\nReduced maintenance overhead\n\nNegative:\n\nSessions will be lost on server restart/crash\nNo persistent audit trail of sessions\nPotential minor increase in memory usage\nMay complicate future horizontal scaling if needed\n\nMitigations:\n\nClear documentation that sessions require re-authentication after a server\nrestart\nImplement proper logging for security events to compensate for lack of\nsession history\nMonitor memory usage in production\nConsider distributed caching solutions if horizontal scaling becomes\nnecessary\n\nImplementation Notes\n\nUse thread-safe in-memory data structure for token storage\nImplement session timeout mechanism\nAdd monitoring

S3-compatible storage systems (AWS S3, MinIO) as the backing\nstore for SPIKE, leveraging their native policy engines for access control.\nRationale\nAuthorization Model\n\nS3’s IAM/policy engine is

Layer\n\nUse AWS SDK for S3 operations\nImplement the storage interface that can work with any S3-compatible system\nEncrypt all data before storage\nUse versioning for secret history\n\nCaching Strategy\n\nImplement in-memory cache for performance\nCache only after confirming S3 permissions\nClear cache on policy changes\nImplement TTL for cached items\n\nPolicy Management\n\nUse a native S3

The secrets\nare encrypted and backed up to a secondary backup storage; however, the primary\nsource of truth is the in-memory store.\nThis is an efficient mechanism to store application secrets (e.g.,\nAPI keys, certificates, even relatively beefy Kubeconfig files).\nHowever, we need to maintain certain requirements for SPIKE to be a\nproduction-grade secure, reliable, and robust secrets store:\nOur requirements include:\n\nHigh-Performance Access: Secrets should be rapidly retrievable with\nminimal latency.\nRobust Backup and Recovery: The system should persist data safely and\nrecover quickly from crashes.\nSecurity: Restrict access to secrets via path-based policies and protect\ndata at rest via encryption.\nAuditability: Record all read/write operations for compliance and\nmonitoring.\nScalability: The system should handle up to hundreds of thousands of\nsecrets.\nHigh Availability: Provide read replicas for scaling reads and failover\nstrategies.\n\nWe considered disk-only, disk-first, cloud-storage-only\n(like AWS S3) and cloud-storage-first solutions and decided a memory-first\nsecrets store with a reliable back-up mechanism is the best fit for SPIKE.\nDecision\nSPIKE will be an in-memory secrets store with the following characteristics:\n\nIn-Memory Data: The primary data store resides in RAM, offering\nnear-instant reads and writes.\nPeriodic Backup: An encrypted backing store (SQLite, Postgres DB, or an\nS3-compatible interface) will serve as a backup. The system uses exponential\nretries to ensure data persistence.\nHardened Container: The service is recommended to run in a hardened\ncontainer or sandbox with minimal OS surface area, reducing the likelihood of\nroot compromise.\nPath-Based Access Controls: Secrets are organized hierarchically\n(for, e.g., /secrets/acme/*). Only specific roles/tokens can access their\nrespective paths.\nReplication: A primary read-write store with read-only replicas. These\nreplicas can be promoted or re-hydrated if the primary fails.\nAuditing: All secret operations (reads, writes, deletes) are logged to\nan audit trail for compliance and investigation.\n\nRationale\n\nPerformance: In-memory data reduces latency compared to purely\ndisk-backed solutions.\nBackup Safety: The secondary backup (encrypted at rest) mitigates memory\nvolatility by allowing the system to recover from unexpected crashes or\nrestarts.\nSecurity:\n\nHardened Container: Minimizes OS-level attack surface.\nEncryption at Rest: Protects offline backups if the disk is compromised.\nPath-Based Policies: Enforces the principle of least privilege.\nAuditing: Aids in compliance and detection of unauthorized access.\nScalability: Storing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of secrets\nin memory is feasible with proper resource planning.\n\n\n\nConsequences\nPositive Outcomes\n\nPerformance Gain: Ultra-fast secrets retrieval for latency-sensitive\napplications.\nBackup Resilience: Encrypted disk backups reduce permanent data loss\nif the container restarts.\nFine-Grained Control*: Path-based policies and an internal auditing\nmechanism meet security and compliance needs.\n\nTrade-Offs and Risks\nIn contrast to our decision, here are some benefits of using a database (or a\nremote object storage) as the single source of truth:\n\nSecurity and Persistence: Using an encrypted database as the source of truth\nensures that secrets are securely stored and persist across system restarts\nor crashes. Though with frequent forced writes, the risk of data loss is\nminimized and can further be mitigated by using mechanisms like message queues.\nScalability: Databases can handle growth more effectively, allowing\nthe system to accommodate the increasing number of secrets without a\nsignificant redesign. Again, this is a non-issue because if you have to store\nmillions of secrets, then you need to review your architecture anyway. In an\nideal world, the only secret an app needs are PKI certificates (like SVIDs) as\nthey can uniquely identify the app.\nSimplicity: A single source of truth simplifies the architecture, making\nthe system easier to develop and maintain. To counter this, SPIKE Nexus’\ncurrent architecture is simple enough to maintain and develop. We have\nabstracted exponential backoff and retry mechanisms to the storage layer, and\nonce we have adequate abstractions, the maintainability of the system will\nbe equivalent to a database-as-the-single-source-of-truth system. Besides,\nat the cost of simplicity, we lose performance and will have to implement\nadditional caching mechanisms to mitigate latency, which will add complexity\nand result in an equally complex system. There is no free lunch.\n\nHere are some other liabilities of a memory-first secrets store:\n\nCrash Consistency: Potential for a small window of data loss if the system\ncrashes just before backup.\n\nMitigation: frequent or near-synchronous write-through.\n\n\nFailover Complexity: Replication and promotion logic must be robustly\nimplemented to handle node failures seamlessly.\nMemory as an Additional Attack Surface:\n\nWhile ephemeral in-memory storage can mitigate certain disk-theft scenarios,\nmemory itself can be inspected if an attacker gains OS-level access.\nThat’s why hardening the container and ensuring proper access controls are\ncrucial. SPIKE assume the machine as the trusted boundary. So, if the\nmachine is compromised, the secrets are considered compromised as well.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKubernetes Secrets Management Best Practices\nHashiCorp Vault High-Availability Reference\nSQLite Encryption Extension Documentation\n\n\n\nADR-0032: Standard 12-Byte Nonce Size for AES-GCM\nADR-0031: AST-Based Test Enforcement for Route Guard Functions\nADR-0030: Minimal Error Messages in API Responses\nADR-0029: Restrict Recovery and Restoration Operations to SPIKE Pilot\nADR-0028: Use Human-Readable Error Messages in CLI Tools\nADR-0027: Separate Audit Logs from Operational Logs\nADR-0026: Configurable Data Directory for SPIKE Components\nADR-0025: Path Patterns as Key Namespaces with Regular Expression Matching\nADR-0024: Transition from In-Memory Cache to Direct Backend Storage for High Availability\nADR-0023: Decision Against Implementing Lock/Unlock Mechanism in SPIKE Nexus\nADR-0022: Continuous Polling of SPIKE Keepers Despite 404 Response\nADR-0021: SPIKE Keeper as a Stateless Shard Holder\nADR-0020: Switch to Zola for Documentation System\nADR-0019: Plugin-Based Storage Backend Architecture\nADR-0018: Administrative Access to SPIKE\nADR-0017: Synchronous Persistence for SPIKE Secrets Store\nADR-0016: Memory-First Secrets Store\nADR-0015: Use Singular Form for File and Package Naming\nADR-0014: Maintaining SQLite as SPIKE’s Primary Storage Backend\nADR-0013: S3-Compatible Storage as SPIKE’s Backing Store\nADR-0012: HTTP Methods for SPIKE API\nADR-0011: PostgreSQL as SPIKE’s Backing Store\nADR-0010: Session Token Storage Strategy for SPIKE Nexus\nADR-0009: Multi-Administrator Support System\nADR-0008: Administrative Access Control System\nADR-0007: Root Key Lifecycle and Management Strategy\nADR-0006: Trust Boundary Definition and Security Assumptions\nADR-0005: Use SPIFFE mTLS for Inter-Component Authentication and Communication\nADR-0004: SPIKE Keeper Minimalist Design Approach\nADR-0003: Root Key Management and Storage Strategy\nADR-0002: Use Docsify for Documentation System\nADR-0001: Display Secrets in Plain Text in SPIKE Pilot Admin CLI\n\n\n\nSPIKE System Overview\nSPIKE Security Model\nSPIKE Architectural Decision Records\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/architecture/adrs/adr-0016/","title":"ADR-0016: Memory-First Secrets Store"},"https://spike.ist/architecture/adrs/adr-0017/":{"body":"ADR-0017: Synchronous Persistence for SPIKE Secrets Store\n\n\nStatus:\n\nSuperseded by ADR-0024: Transition from In-Memory Cache to Direct Backend Storage for High Availabilitye\n\n\nDate: 2025-08-23\nHistory:\n\n2025-01-25: Accepted\n2025-08-23: Superseded by ADR-0024\n\n\nTags: Security, Persistence, Database, Backing-Store, Performance\n\nContext\nSPIKE is a Secrets Store that can use an SQLite backing store (among other\nbacking store options) to persist secrets. However, the source of truth for\nthe secrets is held in memory. SQLite is primarily used as a backup to rehydrate\nsecrets in case the secrets store crashes or needs to be recovered.\nPersistence operations were initially designed to be asynchronous, using methods\nlike AsyncSaveSecret(), to minimize blocking and improve performance. However,\nthis design has introduced unnecessary complexity, race conditions, and edge\ncases, with no significant benefit to the overall system. SQLite, being fast and\nlightweight, already offers sufficient performance without the need for\nadditional asynchronous operations.\nProblem\nThe asynchronous approach to persistence introduces the following issues:\n\nIncreased complexity: Asynchronous operations, while designed to improve\nperformance, add complexity to the system, making it harder to reason about\nand troubleshoot.\nRace conditions and edge cases: The asynchronous operations have led to\npotential race conditions, which compromise the system’s reliability.\nDebugging difficulty: To avoid the race conditions above, we could have\nused abstractions, including Go channels. However, using Go channels and\nasynchronous operations creates challenges for debugging, as tracking state\ntransitions becomes non-trivial.\n\nGiven that SQLite is already fast enough for our needs, the performance benefit\nof using asynchronous operations is minimal. As a result, we no longer see a\nsignificant justification for using asynchronous persistence operations in\nthis context.\nDecision\n\n\nSynchronous Persistence: All database persistence operations will now be\nsynchronous.\n\nJustification: Since SQLite is fast enough, and we are not seeing\nperformance bottlenecks at the database level, the simplicity of synchronous\noperations outweighs the potential complexity of maintaining asynchronous\nones.\nExpected Outcome: This decision reduces the complexity of the codebase,\neliminates the potential for race conditions, and makes the system easier\nto debug and maintain. We will continue to monitor for any performance\nimpact that might arise due to this decision.\n\n\n\nFallback to Async if Performance Issues Arise: In the unlikely event that\nwe observe significant performance issues with synchronous operations, we\nwill consider optimizing specific areas locally.\n\nOptimization Strategy: If performance degradation is observed, we will\nexplore optimization options such as local caching, batching of persistence\noperations, or fine-tuning SQLite settings. Asynchronous operations may be\nreintroduced selectively in these cases.\n\n\n\nConsequences\n\nReduced Complexity: By removing asynchronous operations, the system will\nbe simpler and easier to maintain, with fewer edge cases and race conditions\nto handle.\nPerformance Tradeoff: Synchronous operations may result in slight\nperformance degradation if there is a heavy load on the persistence layer.\nHowever, this is unlikely given the current design and SQLite’s speed.\nEasier Debugging: The synchronous model simplifies debugging, as there are\nno concurrent operations that need to be tracked.\n\nAlternatives Considered\n\nAsync Persistence: We initially considered keeping asynchronous operations\nto prevent blocking and improve performance. However, this would introduce\ncomplexity that isn’t justified by the system’s current requirements and\nSQLite’s speed.\nGo Channels for Sync Operations: Using Go channels to handle\nsynchronization in asynchronous operations was also considered, but it would\nincrease debugging complexity and not address the core issue effectively.\n\n\nThis ADR will be revisited if performance issues arise, but for now, the shift\nto synchronous persistence aligns with the goal of simplifying the codebase and\nimproving system stability.\n\n\nADR-0032: Standard 12-Byte Nonce Size for AES-GCM\nADR-0031: AST-Based Test Enforcement for Route Guard Functions\nADR-0030: Minimal Error Messages in API Responses\nADR-0029: Restrict Recovery and Restoration Operations to SPIKE Pilot\nADR-0028: Use Human-Readable Error Messages in CLI Tools\nADR-0027: Separate Audit Logs from Operational Logs\nADR-0026: Configurable Data Directory for SPIKE Components\nADR-0025: Path Patterns as Key Namespaces with Regular Expression Matching\nADR-0024: Transition from In-Memory Cache to Direct Backend Storage for High Availability\nADR-0023: Decision Against Implementing Lock/Unlock Mechanism in SPIKE Nexus\nADR-0022: Continuous Polling of SPIKE Keepers Despite 404 Response\nADR-0021: SPIKE Keeper as a Stateless Shard Holder\nADR-0020: Switch to Zola for Documentation System\nADR-0019: Plugin-Based Storage Backend Architecture\nADR-0018: Administrative Access to SPIKE\nADR-0017: Synchronous Persistence for SPIKE Secrets Store\nADR-0016: Memory-First Secrets Store\nADR-0015: Use Singular Form for File and Package Naming\nADR-0014: Maintaining SQLite as SPIKE’s Primary Storage Backend\nADR-0013: S3-Compatible Storage as SPIKE’s Backing Store\nADR-0012: HTTP Methods for SPIKE API\nADR-0011: PostgreSQL as SPIKE’s Backing Store\nADR-0010: Session Token Storage Strategy for SPIKE Nexus\nADR-0009: Multi-Administrator Support System\nADR-0008: Administrative Access Control System\nADR-0007: Root Key Lifecycle and Management Strategy\nADR-0006: Trust Boundary Definition and Security Assumptions\nADR-0005: Use SPIFFE mTLS for Inter-Component Authentication and Communication\nADR-0004: SPIKE Keeper Minimalist Design Approach\nADR-0003: Root Key Management and Storage Strategy\nADR-0002: Use Docsify for Documentation System\nADR-0001: Display Secrets in Plain Text in SPIKE Pilot Admin CLI\n\n\n\nSPIKE System Overview\nSPIKE Security Model\nSPIKE Architectural Decision Records\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/architecture/adrs/adr-0017/","title":"ADR-0017: Synchronous Persistence for SPIKE Secrets Store"},"https://spike.ist/architecture/adrs/adr-0018/":{"body":"ADR-0018: Administrative Access to SPIKE\n\n\nStatus: accepted\nData: 2025-02-20\nTags: Security, Administrative-Access, SPIFFE, IDM, DR\n\nContext\nSPIKE requires a robust and secure administrative access model to balance\noperational flexibility, security, and auditability. To achieve this,\nSPIKE defines three predefined roles for emergency Disaster Recovery (DR)\nand superadmin access, while delegating named administrative access to an\nexternal identity management system.\nDecision\nRole-Based Administrative Access\nAdministrative access in SPIKE is granted using specific SPIFFE IDs:\n*spiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/superuser - Super Admin:\nCan perform all administrative tasks except recovery or restore operations.\n*spiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/recover - Recovery User:\nCan only recover the root key shards to the local file system.\n*spiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/restore - Restore User:\nCan only restore the root key by providing one shard at a time.\nThis role separation ensures that:\n\n\nDifferent users can have distinct operational responsibilities.

Fault-Tolerance\n\nContext\nSPIKE Nexus is the core secret store that generates and manages the\nroot encryption key. To ensure availability and resilience, the root key\nis sharded using Shamir’s Secret Sharing Scheme and distributed to multiple\nSPIKE Keeper instances. These SPIKE Keepers are responsible for holding\ntheir respective key shards in memory to support the recovery process in\ncase SPIKE Nexus needs to reconstruct its root key.\nA key design principle in SPIKE is simplicity and minimalism:\nThe SPIKE Keeper component should remain as lightweight as possible,\navoiding unnecessary complexity such as awareness of Nexus, complex\nconfiguration, or inter-Keeper communication. Instead, SPIKE Nexus should\nmaintain full control over key management while leveraging SPIKE Keepers\nas dumb storage units for key shards.\nDecision\nSPIKE Keepers remain stateless and unaware of SPIKE Nexus:\n\nSPIKE Keepers do not need to know which SPIKE Nexus instance they are\nserving.\nThey store their assigned key shard in-memory and do not persist in any\nstate.\n\nZero configuration for SPIKE Keepers:\n\nSPIKE Keepers have no static configuration files or runtime parameters\nrelated to SPIKE Nexus.\nDeployment should be as simple as running a SPIKE Keeper instance without\nadditional setup.\n\nSPIKE Nexus is responsible for lifecycle management:\n\nSPIKE Nexus generates the root key, sharding it and distributing the\npieces to SPIKE Keepers.\nSPIKE Nexus polls Keepers to check their health and ensure that a quorum\nis available.\nIf a SPIKE Keeper goes down and restarts, SPIKE Nexus is responsible\nfor rehydrating it with the correct key shard.\n\nPolling-based health monitoring and rehydration:\n\nSPIKE Keepers do not initiate communication with SPIKE Nexus.\n\nInstead, SPIKE Nexus periodically queries SPIKE Keepers for their\nstatus.\n\n\nIf a SPIKE Keeper is found to be empty (e.g., after a restart),\nSPIKE Nexus reassigns the missing shard.\n\nRationale\n\nSecurity: SPIKE Keepers hold only a single shard, which is not\nadequate to regenerate the root key. They are never aware of other\nSPIKE Keepers or the full key. This limits their attack surface.\nSimplicity: By removing configuration and inter-service dependencies,\nSPIKE Keepers become easy to deploy, replace, and scale.\nAvailability: The polling and rehydration mechanism ensures that\nSPIKE Nexus* can automatically recover lost shards without manual\nintervention.\nFault Tolerance: Stateless SPIKE Keepers can be replaced without\nrequiring reconfiguration or coordination with other components.\n\nConsequences\nPositive\n\nSimplifies Keeper deployment and operation.\nImproves security by ensuring Keepers never hold full knowledge of the system.\nEnhances reliability by making Keepers easily replaceable without system-wide\nimpact.\nReduces operational burden since SPIKE Nexus automatically manages the\nlifecycle of SPIKE Keepers and their shards.\n\nNegative\n\nSPIKE Nexus must handle additional logic for polling, health monitoring,\nand rehydration.\nSPIKE Keepers depend on SPIKE Nexus for their purpose, making them\nentirely reliant on SPIKE Nexus’ availability.\n\nAlternatives Considered\nSPIKE Keepers as Stateful Services:\n\nRejected because it adds complexity and requires persistent storage.\nWould introduce additional configuration and synchronization challenges.\n\nSPIKE Keepers Managing Their Own Shards:\n\nRejected as it violates the principle of keeping SPIKE Keepers unaware\nof the full system state.\nWould require SPIKE Keepers to store metadata about SPIKE Nexus,\nincreasing complexity and risk.\n\nPush-Based Shard Distribution Instead of Polling:\n\nRejected because it would require SPIKE Keepers to maintain knowledge of\nSPIKE Nexus.\nPolling ensures that SPIKE Keepers can remain stateless and unaware of\nthe system topology.\n\nDecision Outcome\nThis decision is final unless significant operational issues arise.

The lock state would be\npersisted in the backing store and enforced across all Nexus instances, with the\nroot key zeroed out in memory. This was intended to provide a system-wide freeze\nfor security or operational reasons.\nHowever, this approach introduces significant complexity, especially in\nhigh-availability (HA) and distributed deployments. It also creates new\noperational and security risks and may not align with SPIFFE-native best\npractices.\nDecision Drivers\n\nSimplicity and maintainability of the SPIKE architecture\nSecurity model alignment with SPIFFE/SPIRE\nOperational clarity and reliability in HA/distributed setups\nAvoiding unnecessary complexity and performance overhead\nLeveraging existing SPIRE mechanisms for system-level access control\n\nConsidered Options\n\nImplement a lock/unlock mechanism in SPIKE Nexus (persisted in the backing\nstore, enforced at API level)\nUse SPIRE registration entry management (delete/disable Nexus entries to “lock” the system)\nRely on infrastructure-level controls (e.g., scaling down Nexus, process management)\nDo nothing (status quo)\n\nDecision\nSPIKE Nexus will NOT implement a lock/unlock API or CLI feature.\nInstead, operators are recommended to achieve system-level locking by either:\n\nManaging SPIRE registration entries: Removing or disabling the relevant\nSPIRE registration entries for SPIKE Nexus will immediately block all\nauthenticated API access, effectively freezing the system in a secure,\nauditable, and SPIFFE-native way.\nUsing infrastructure-level controls: Scaling down the Nexus deployment,\nstopping Nexus processes, or otherwise restricting access at the\ninfrastructure level are also valid and supported approaches.\n\nThese methods are the supported and recommended ways to “lock” the system.\nNo additional lock/unlock API or CLI subcommand will be provided by\nSPIKE Nexus at this time.\nA sample script for SPIRE registration entry management:\n\nRationale\n\nSimplicity: Avoids introducing distributed consensus, state management,\nand API enforcement logic for a rarely used feature.\nSecurity: SPIRE registration entries are the root of trust; removing them\nis the most secure and auditable way to block access. Infrastructure controls\nare also robust and well-understood.\nOperational Clarity: The lock/unlock state is unambiguous and enforced\nat the trust boundary or infrastructure, not in application logic.\nHA/Scaling: No need for all Nexus instances to coordinate or poll a\nshared lock state, avoiding performance and reliability issues.\nSPIFFE-Native: Embraces the SPIFFE/SPIRE model for access control,\nrather than reinventing similar mechanisms in SPIKE.\n\nConsequences\nPositive\n\nSimpler, more maintainable codebase\nNo performance or reliability impact on Nexus API\nLocking is enforced at the trust boundary (SPIRE), not in application logic\nImmediate effect across all Nexus instances\nNo risk of partial lock or split-brain scenarios\nAligns with SPIFFE-native best practices\n\nNegative\n\nLocking/unlocking requires SPIRE server access (not just SPIKE operator\nprivileges)—This can be seen as a “positive” consequence, too, as it\nprovides an additional level of isolation and security.\nNo fine-grained or temporary lock state within SPIKE Nexus itself\nSome operational scenarios (e.g., “pause but keep registration”) are not\ndirectly supported\n\nAlternatives Considered\nImplementing Lock/Unlock in SPIKE Nexus\n\nRejected due to complexity, risk of split-brain, performance overhead,\nand operational ambiguity in HA setups.\nWould require distributed consensus or polling and add significant code and\noperational burden.\n\nInfrastructure-Level Controls\n\nScaling down Nexus or killing processes is effective but “nuclear” and may\ndisrupt monitoring, logging, or other integrations.\n\nDirect DB Manipulation\n\nNot recommended or supported, but possible for those with privileged access.\nNot considered a safe or auditable approach.\n\nDecision Outcome\nThis ADR documents the decision to rely on SPIRE registration entry management\nor infrastructure-level controls for system-level “locking” of SPIKE Nexus,\nand to avoid implementing a separate lock/unlock API or CLI feature in\nSPIKE Nexus itself.\nThis decision may be revisited if/when a true SPIKE Nexus HA topology is\nimplemented and operational experience suggests a different approach is\nwarranted.\n\n\nADR-0032: Standard 12-Byte Nonce Size for AES-GCM\nADR-0031: AST-Based Test Enforcement for Route Guard Functions\nADR-0030: Minimal Error Messages in API Responses\nADR-0029: Restrict Recovery and Restoration Operations to SPIKE Pilot\nADR-0028: Use Human-Readable Error Messages in CLI Tools\nADR-0027: Separate Audit Logs from Operational Logs\nADR-0026: Configurable Data Directory for SPIKE Components\nADR-0025: Path Patterns as Key Namespaces with Regular Expression Matching\nADR-0024: Transition from In-Memory Cache to Direct Backend Storage for High Availability\nADR-0023: Decision Against Implementing Lock/Unlock Mechanism in SPIKE Nexus\nADR-0022: Continuous Polling of SPIKE Keepers Despite 404 Response\nADR-0021: SPIKE Keeper as a Stateless Shard Holder\nADR-0020: Switch to Zola for Documentation System\nADR-0019: Plugin-Based Storage Backend Architecture\nADR-0018: Administrative Access to SPIKE\nADR-0017: Synchronous Persistence for SPIKE Secrets Store\nADR-0016: Memory-First Secrets Store\nADR-0015: Use Singular Form for File and Package Naming\nADR-0014: Maintaining SQLite as SPIKE’s Primary Storage Backend\nADR-0013: S3-Compatible Storage as SPIKE’s Backing Store\nADR-0012: HTTP Methods for SPIKE API\nADR-0011: PostgreSQL as SPIKE’s Backing Store\nADR-0010: Session Token Storage Strategy for SPIKE Nexus\nADR-0009: Multi-Administrator Support System\nADR-0008: Administrative Access Control System\nADR-0007: Root Key Lifecycle and Management Strategy\nADR-0006: Trust Boundary Definition and Security Assumptions\nADR-0005: Use SPIFFE mTLS for Inter-Component Authentication and Communication\nADR-0004: SPIKE Keeper Minimalist Design Approach\nADR-0003: Root Key Management and Storage Strategy\nADR-0002: Use Docsify for Documentation System\nADR-0001: Display Secrets in Plain Text in SPIKE Pilot Admin CLI\n\n\n\nSPIKE System Overview\nSPIKE Security Model\nSPIKE Architectural Decision Records\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/architecture/adrs/adr-0023/","title":"ADR-0023: Decision Against Implementing Lock/Unlock Mechanism in SPIKE Nexus"},"https://spike.ist/architecture/adrs/adr-0024/":{"body":"ADR-0024: Transition from In-Memory Cache to Direct Backend Storage for High Availability\n\nStatus: accepted\n\nSupersedes: ADR-0016: Memory-First Secrets Store\nSupersedes: ADR-0017: Synchronous Persistence\n\n\nDate: 2025-08-23\nTags: Security, Operations, HA, Simplicity\n\nContext\nSPIKE Nexus currently uses a dual-layer storage architecture where an\nin-memory cache (secretStore using kv.KV and policies using sync.Map)\nserves as the primary source of truth, with a backing store (SQLite, S3, etc.)\nproviding persistence. This design pattern follows\nADR-0016 (Memory-First Secrets Store) and\nADR-0017 (Synchronous Persistence).\nWhile this architecture provides excellent performance for single-instance\ndeployments, it creates challenges that unnecessarily increase the\narchitectural complexity of the distributed system when attempting to achieve\nhigh availability (HA) through horizontal scaling:\nCurrent Architecture Issues:\n\nSplit-brain scenarios: Multiple instances behind a load balancer can\nmaintain independent in-memory states, leading to inconsistent data views\nVersion drift: When instance A and instance B update the same secret\npath, they maintain different version numbers in their local memory stores\nLost updates: Without distributed locking, concurrent updates from\ndifferent instances can silently overwrite each other\nInconsistent reads: Users can receive different responses depending on\nwhich instance handles their request\nComplex synchronization: Maintaining cache coherency across instances\nwould require additional infrastructure (message buses, distributed locks,\nconsensus protocols)\n\nExample Scenario:\n\nDecision\nWe will eliminate the in-memory cache layer entirely and make all secret and\npolicy operations interact directly with the backing store.\nThis change involves:\n\n\nRemove global in-memory stores:\n\nComment out secretStore (kv.KV) and secretStoreMu\nComment out policies (sync.Map)\n\n\n\nRefactor all operations to use backend directly:\n\nGetSecret() → Read from persist.Backend().LoadSecret()\nUpsertSecret() → Write to persist.Backend().StoreSecret()\nwith atomic operations\nDeleteSecret() → Update backend with deletion timestamps\nSimilar changes for policy operations\n\n\n\nMove version management to persistence layer:\n\nImplement compare-and-swap (CAS) operations in the backend\nUse optimistic locking to handle concurrent updates\nMaintain version consistency at the database level\n\n\n\nTransform NoopStore to InMemoryStore:\n\nFor development/testing scenarios requiring true in-memory operation\nImplement full Backend interface using kv.KV internally\nProvide the same semantics as persistent backends\n\n\n\nAlternatives Considered\n\nDistributed cache with cache invalidation: Add Redis/Hazelcast with\npub/sub for cache invalidation.

This creates challenges for:\n\nCompliance requirements that mandate immutable audit trails with specific\nretention policies\nSecurity teams needing to route audit events to SIEM systems\nDifferent access controls between audit and operational logs\nPerformance optimization as audit logs have different characteristics\nthan operational logs\n\nWe need to determine the most effective way to separate audit logs from\noperational logs while maintaining simplicity and Kubernetes-native practices.\nDecision Drivers\n\nCompliance requirements: Audit logs often need years of retention\nversus days/weeks for operational logs\nSecurity isolation: Audit logs require stricter access controls and\ntamper-evident storage\nOperational simplicity: Solution should work seamlessly in Kubernetes\nenvironments\nPerformance considerations: Different log volumes and processing\nrequirements\nIntegration flexibility: Easy routing to different backends\n(SIEM versus observability stacks)\n\nCurrent Implementation\nSPIKE currently implements a basic audit logging system that outputs to stdout\nalongside operational logs. The implementation consists of:\nArchitecture\n\n\nWrapper-Based Auditing (internal/net/handle.go):\n\nHandleRoute() wraps all HTTP handlers with audit logging\nAutomatically creates an AuditEntry for each request\nLogs two events per request: entry (AuditEnter) and exit\n(AuditExit)\nTracks request duration and completion state (AuditSuccess or\nAuditErrored)\nGenerates unique trail IDs using crypto.ID()\n\n\n\nRoute-Level Auditing (e.g.,\napp/keeper/internal/route/store/contribute.go):\n\nEach route handler receives an *journal.AuditEntry parameter\njournal.AuditRequest() logs specific actions (create, read, delete,\nlist, etc.)\nUpdates the audit entry with component name, path, resource, and action\nProvides fine-grained operation tracking within the request lifecycle\n\n\n\nAudit Entry Structure (internal/journal/audit.go):\n\n\n\nOutput Mechanism:\n\njournal.Audit() marshals entries to JSON\nOutputs to stdout via fmt.Println()\nCrashes with log.FatalLn() if JSON marshaling fails (fail-secure)\n\n\n\nAudit Actions\nThe system defines specific audit actions:\n\nAuditEnter / AuditExit: Request lifecycle\nAuditCreate: Resource creation\nAuditRead: Resource retrieval\nAuditList: Resource listing\nAuditDelete: Resource deletion\nAuditUndelete: Resource restoration\nAuditFallback: Undefined route access\nAuditBlocked: Blocked/unauthorized access\n\nCurrent Limitations\n\nNo separation: Audit logs mix with operational logs on stdout\nNo tamper detection: Events lack HMAC signatures\nNo guaranteed delivery: Uses stdout without delivery confirmation\nLimited metadata: Missing SPIFFE ID, source IP, and other security\ncontext\nSingle output: Cannot route to multiple destinations simultaneously\n\nConsidered Options\n\nUse stderr for audit logs (stdout for operational)\nStructured logging with type field (both to stdout)\nDedicated audit sidecar pattern\nDirect audit system integration (separate API calls)\nPluggable audit devices (Vault-style architecture)\n\nDecision\nImplement a two-phase approach:\nPhase 1 (Immediate): Use stderr for audit logs while keeping operational\nlogs on stdout, with structured JSON format and clear prefixes.\nPhase 2 (Future): Evolve to pluggable audit devices.\nRationale\nPhase 1 Justification\n\nImmediate value: Can be implemented quickly with minimal changes\nKubernetes-native: Works with existing log collectors (Fluentd/Fluent Bit)\nClear separation: File descriptors provide OS-level isolation\n\nPhase 2 Justification\n\nEnterprise readiness: Matches proven patterns for log collection and\nrouting\nFlexibility: Supports file, socket, syslog, and custom backends\nGuaranteed delivery: Can implement blocking behavior when audit fails\nCompliance: Better suits enterprise audit requirements\n\nWhy Not Other Options\n\nStructured logging only: Doesn’t provide strong enough separation for\ncompliance\nSidecar pattern: Adds complexity without clear benefits over stderr\napproach\nDirect integration only: Less flexible, harder to adapt to different\nenvironments\n\nImplementation Details\nPhase 1 Implementation\nPhase 1 builds on the existing audit infrastructure by redirecting audit\noutput to stderr while enhancing the AuditEntry structure:\n\nKey Changes from Current Implementation:\n\nChange fmt.Println() to fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, ...) in\njournal.Audit()\nAdd SPIFFE ID field (extract from request context in HandleRoute())\nAdd source IP field (extract from http.Request)\nOptional HMAC signing for tamper detection\n\nPhase 2 Architecture\nPhase 2 extends the audit system with pluggable devices while maintaining\nbackward compatibility with the existing journal.Audit() interface:\n\nMigration Path\nCurrent → Phase 1:\n\nModify internal/journal/audit.go:\n\nChange fmt.Println() to fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, ...)\nAdd SPIFFE ID and SourceIP fields to AuditEntry\n\n\nModify internal/net/handle.go:\n\nExtract SPIFFE ID from request context\nExtract source IP from http.Request.RemoteAddr\nPopulate new fields in AuditEntry\n\n\nUpdate Kubernetes log collectors to route stderr separately\nOptional: Implement HMAC signing for tamper detection\n\nPhase 1 → Phase 2:\n\nCreate AuditDevice interface and implementations\nAdd AuditManager initialization in service startup code\nModify journal.Audit() to write to configured devices\nAdd configuration for audit device selection and options\nMaintain stderr output for backward compatibility\n\nSample Kubernetes Configuration\n\nImplementation Status\nWhat Works Today (Current)\n\n✅ Structured audit logging with AuditEntry and AuditLogLine\n✅ Automatic request lifecycle tracking (enter/exit)\n✅ Wrapper-based auditing via HandleRoute()\n✅ Route-level audit

Most operations can be controlled through\nSPIKE’s policy system, allowing fine-grained access control based on SPIFFE IDs\nand other attributes.\nHowever, recovery and restoration operations are fundamentally different\nfrom regular operations:\n\nRecovery initiates the process of retrieving Shamir secret shards when\nSPIKE Nexus needs to be restored from a catastrophic failure\nRestoration submits these shards back to rebuild the root encryption key\n\nThese operations bypass normal secret access policies and directly manipulate\nthe root cryptographic material that protects the entire secrets store. If\ncompromised, an attacker could potentially decrypt all secrets in the system.\nWe need to determine the appropriate access control mechanism for these\ncritical recovery operations.\nDecision\nRecovery (Recover) and restoration (Restore) operations will be restricted\nexclusively to SPIKE Pilot at the SDK level, enforced through SPIFFE ID\nvalidation.\nSpecifically:\n\nThe SDK will check the caller’s SPIFFE ID using spiffeid.IsPilot()\nOnly workloads identified as SPIKE Pilot may invoke these operations\nViolations will result in immediate fatal termination via log.FatalErr()\nThis restriction is not configurable through policies\n\nAll other operations (secrets, policies, cipher, ACLs) remain policy-controlled\nand can be authorized for any workload based on configured policies.\nRationale\nSecurity Criticality Hierarchy\nSPIKE operations fall into different security tiers:\nOperation TypeSecurity ImpactAccess Control\nSecret read/writeMedium -

AST-Based Test Enforcement for Route Guard Functions\n\n\nStatus: accepted\nDate: 2024-11-27\nTags: Security, Testing, Authorization, Code Quality\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nSPIKE Nexus and SPIKE Keeper route handlers must perform authorization checks\nbefore processing requests. The established pattern uses net.ReadParseAndGuard\nwhich accepts a guard function parameter that is executed internally. However,\nthere is no compile-time or automated mechanism to ensure new route handlers\nfollow this pattern.\nA contributor adding a new route could forget to include guard function\ninvocation, creating an authorization bypass vulnerability. Code review catches\nmost issues, but human oversight is fallible.\nDecision Drivers\n\nSecurity: Every route must have authorization checks\nDeveloper experience: Should not add excessive boilerplate\nMaintainability: Solution should be self-documenting\nCI integration: Violations should be caught before merge\nFlexibility: Must support both standard and custom guard patterns\n\nConsidered Options\n\nMandatory guard parameter on route registration - Pass guard function to\nall routes, but this does not guarantee the guard is actually called\nWrapper function approach - SecureRoute(pattern, guard, handler) that\nalways calls guard before handler\nInterface-based handlers - Require SecureHandler interface with\nGuard() and Handle() methods\nAST-based test - Scan route handler code and verify guard invocation\nConvention + code review only - Document the pattern and rely on review\n\nDecision\nImplement an AST-based test that scans all route handler files and verifies\neach Route* function contains a guard invocation.\nThe test recognizes multiple valid patterns:\n\nnet.ReadParseAndGuard calls (standard JSON route pattern)\nFunctions starting with guard (e.g., guardPolicyDeleteRequest)\nKnown guarded helper functions (e.g., handleJSONDecrypt for cipher routes\nthat support streaming)\n\nRationale\n\nNo code changes required - existing pattern works as-is\nCI enforcement - test fails if any route lacks guard invocation\nSelf-documenting - test code documents the convention\nZero runtime overhead - purely a test-time check\nFlexible - supports existing cipher routes that use custom guard patterns\ndue to streaming support\n\nThe existing net.ReadParseAndGuard pattern already guarantees guard execution\nfor routes that use it. The AST test ensures all routes use either this pattern\nor an equivalent guard invocation.\nConsequences\nPositive\n\nAuthorization bypass vulnerabilities are caught automatically in CI\nNew contributors learn the pattern from test failure messages\nNo changes to production code or runtime behavior\nTest serves as living documentation of the guard convention\n\nNegative\n\nTest must be updated if new guarded helper functions are added\nAST parsing adds test complexity\nFalse positives possible if function naming conventions change\n\nImplementation Notes\nSPIKE Nexus\nThe test is located at app/nexus/internal/route/base/guard_test.go and:\n\nScans subdirectories: acl/policy, bootstrap, cipher, operator,\nsecret\nFinds functions starting with Route\nVerifies each calls a guard (via ReadParseAndGuard, guard* functions,\nor known guarded helpers)\nReports all violations with file paths and function names\n\nUtility files (errors.go, guard.go, handle.go, etc.) are skipped as they\ndo not contain route handlers.\nSPIKE Keeper\nA similar test is located at app/keeper/internal/route/base/guard_test.go and:\n\nScans the store subdirectory\nFinds functions starting with Route\nVerifies each calls a guard (via ReadParseAndGuard or guard* functions)\nReports all violations with file paths and function names\n\nSPIKE Keeper has fewer routes (shard contribution and retrieval) but they are\nequally critical since they handle root key shards.\n\n\nADR-0032: Standard 12-Byte Nonce Size for AES-GCM\nADR-0031: AST-Based Test Enforcement for Route Guard Functions\nADR-0030: Minimal Error Messages in API Responses\nADR-0029: Restrict Recovery and Restoration Operations to SPIKE Pilot\nADR-0028: Use Human-Readable Error Messages in CLI Tools\nADR-0027: Separate Audit Logs from Operational Logs\nADR-0026: Configurable Data Directory for SPIKE Components\nADR-0025: Path Patterns as Key Namespaces with Regular Expression Matching\nADR-0024: Transition from In-Memory Cache to Direct Backend Storage for High Availability\nADR-0023: Decision Against Implementing Lock/Unlock Mechanism in SPIKE Nexus\nADR-0022: Continuous Polling of SPIKE Keepers Despite 404 Response\nADR-0021: SPIKE Keeper as a Stateless Shard Holder\nADR-0020: Switch to Zola for Documentation System\nADR-0019: Plugin-Based Storage Backend Architecture\nADR-0018: Administrative Access to SPIKE\nADR-0017: Synchronous Persistence for SPIKE Secrets Store\nADR-0016: Memory-First Secrets Store\nADR-0015: Use Singular Form for File and Package Naming\nADR-0014: Maintaining SQLite as SPIKE’s Primary Storage Backend\nADR-0013: S3-Compatible Storage as SPIKE’s Backing Store\nADR-0012: HTTP Methods for SPIKE API\nADR-0011: PostgreSQL as SPIKE’s Backing Store\nADR-0010: Session Token Storage Strategy for SPIKE Nexus\nADR-0009: Multi-Administrator Support System\nADR-0008: Administrative Access Control System\nADR-0007: Root Key Lifecycle and Management Strategy\nADR-0006: Trust Boundary Definition and Security Assumptions\nADR-0005: Use SPIFFE mTLS for Inter-Component Authentication and Communication\nADR-0004: SPIKE Keeper Minimalist Design Approach\nADR-0003: Root Key Management and Storage Strategy\nADR-0002: Use Docsify for Documentation System\nADR-0001: Display Secrets in Plain Text in SPIKE Pilot Admin CLI\n\n\n\nSPIKE System Overview\nSPIKE Security Model\nSPIKE Architectural Decision Records\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/architecture/adrs/adr-0031/","title":"ADR-0031: AST-Based Test Enforcement for Route Guard Functions"},"https://spike.ist/architecture/adrs/adr-0032/":{"body":"ADR-0032: Standard 12-Byte Nonce Size for AES-GCM\n\n\nStatus: accepted\nDate: 2024-11-27\nTags: Security, Cryptography, AES-GCM\n\nContext and Problem Statement\nSPIKE uses AES-GCM for symmetric encryption in several places:\n\nCipher API (encryption as a service)\nBootstrap verification\nBackend storage encryption\n\nGCM technically supports multiple nonce sizes via Go’s cipher.NewGCMWithNonceSize(),\nbut the standard 12-byte (96-bit) nonce is recommended by NIST.

SPIKE\nsupports Linux and the BSD family (including macOS). Windows is not currently\nsupported, though some early prototyping is a work in progress.\nSPIKE (with the help of SPIFFE and SPIRE) adheres to the zero trust\nnetworking security model in which it is assumed that network communication is\nhostile or presumably fully compromised. That said, it is also assumed that\nthe hardware on which *SPIKE components run, as well as its operators,\nis trustworthy.\nIf the hardware is considered as an attack surface, or insider threats are\npart of the threat model, then careful considerations should be made around\nkey components. The physical placement of SPIRE Server, SPIKE Nexus,\nand SPIKE Keeperinstances, and the security of their relevant configuration\nparameters will be important.\nAuthentication and Communication\n\nAll inter-component communication is secured through SPIFFE mTLS.\nComponents identify each other using their SVIDs.\nNetwork-level security is provided by SPIFFE mTLS.\n\nTrust Boundaries\nThe primary trust boundary is at the machine level. Once the machine is\ncompromised, hardening SPIKE components will provide diminishing returns.\nIn that regard, both physical and OS-level security is important.\nFor example, when the machine is compromised, an attacker with sufficient\nprivileges can observe and control the memory of SPIKE Nexus, or\nSPIKE Keeper; they can inject their counterfeit workloads; they can modify\nSPIRE and create their own registration entries\nIt’s also worth noticing that, since SPIKE Keeper backs ups the root key\nin memory, if SPIKE Keeper is compromised, the machine can be considered\ncompromised.\nFor containerized deployments, both SPIKE Nexus and SPIKE Keeper\nshall be hardened.\nThreat Model Exceptions\nThe following are not considered part of SPIKE’s threat model:\n\nProtecting against the control of the storage backend: Any storage backend\nis considered untrustworthy by SPIKE, so any data saved in the storage\nbackend is encrypted at rest, and only SPIKE Nexus can decrypt it.\nAn attacker can perform arbitrary operations against the storage backend,\nIt is not SPIKE’s responsibility to protect the storage backend itself;\nSPIKE only ensures that an attacker accessing the storage backend cannot\nreveal the data stored there.\nProtecting against memory analysis of running system components: If an\nattacker can inspect the memory state of any component, then they already have\ndirect access to the machine (which is our primary trust boundary). If this\nhappens, then the confidentiality of the data may be compromised. Preventing\nmemory analysis is a common system security best practice, and it is out\nof scope for SPIKE to enforce such measures.\n\nSystem administrators should implement the following security measures to\nprevent memory analysis:\n\nSet /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope to 2 or 3:\n\nValue 2 restricts ptrace to root-only access\nValue 3 disables ptrace completely, offering maximum security\n\n\nMake this setting permanent by adding kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 2 to\n/etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf\nConsider using SELinux or AppArmor profiles to further restrict\nprocess debugging capabilities\nIf running in a container, ensure the container runtime is configured to\ndisable ptrace capabilities (e.g.,\nusing --security-opt=no-new-privileges in Docker)\nRegular audit of processes with CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability, as this can\nbypass ptrace restrictions\n\n\n\n\nProtecting against malicious code execution on the underlying host system.\nThis is again the system administrator’s responsibility. SPIKE cannot\nprotect against malicious code execution as that ability likely requires\nadministrative privileges, which should be avoided for SPIKE components\nin the first place to prevent privilege escalation.\nProtecting against the underlying system’s flaws. The systems shall be\nup to date with respect to dependencies, properly secured, monitored, and\nhardened.\nProtecting against ill intent of SPIKE super admins: SPIKE assumes\ntrust for super administrators. Any malicious actions performed by super\nadmins, such as abusing their elevated privileges, are considered out of\nscope for SPIKE’s threat model. It is the organization’s responsibility\nto enforce proper checks, balances, and monitoring mechanisms for super\nadmin activities.\nProtecting against SPIKE administrators supplying vulnerable or malicious\nconfiguration data. This includes both intentional or unintentional\nmisconfiguration—an administrator is supposed to know what they are doing.\nAny data provided as configuration values to SPIKE should be\nvalidated. Misconfiguration of SPIKE, or SPIFFE can result in the\ncompromise of the confidentiality or the integrity of the data stored.\n\nThe Backing Store is Untrusted\nSince the storage backend resides outside the trusted boundary, SPIKE\ntreats it as untrusted and encrypts data before sending it. This ensures that\neven if a malicious attacker gains access to the storage backend, the data\nremains secure, as it can only be decrypted by SPIKE Nexus.\nAdditionally, the storage backend serves as a durable, persistent layer,\nensuring data availability across application crashes and server restarts.\nEspecially when using an external data store other than the default local\nSQLite backing store, although SPIKE assumes the store is untrusted,\nstill considering the following will be prudent:\n\nIf possible, have SPIKE’s backing store as an isolated database not shared\nby any other service to reduce the attack surface.\nIf that’s not possible and the backing store is a shared database with other\nservices, be aware of who else has access to it and manages it?\nBe cognizant about how SPIKE Nexus will authenticate to this database.\nMake sure the database connection is secure with TLS or mTLS.\n\nNetwork Isolation of SPIKE Keepers\nSPIKE Keepers do not have any communication pathway between each other, and this\nis a decision by design. This significantly limits the possibility of lateral\nmovements as even when an attacker gains a foothold on a SPIKE Keeper instance,\nthey cannot laterally move to other SPIKE Keeper instances.\nSPIKE Nexus and SPIKE Keepers establish a hub-spoke topology where SPIKE\nKeepers (the spokes) can only communicate with SPIKE Nexus (the hub).\nSPIKE Keeper Shard Distribution and Disaster Recovery\nSPIKE uses SPIKE Keepers, which are apps responsible for storing\nShamir shards of the root key. Both the root key and the\nshards are always in memory and never persisted to disk.\nSPIKE Nexus can establish a SPIFFE-based mTLS connection to request a shard\nfrom a SPIKE Keeper, enabling the system to auto-recover itself.\nThe security model allows for different levels of redundancy and control:\n\nA typical setup could involve three SPIKE Keeper instances. No single\nshare can reconstruct the root key alone, ensuring security. However, multiple\nshares can be combined to restore the system when needed.\nSPIKE Nexus often automatically recovers itself from crashes using\nSPIKE Keepers. However, for the unlikely case of a total system crash,\neach administrator can hold one of these shares and use spike restore to\nrestore the system back to normal. Since a single shard cannot recreate\nthe root key, we are mitigating risk by distributing trust.\nFor those less concerned with strict separation, an alternative approach\ncould involve storing both shares on a single thumb drive or distributing\ntwo shares across separate thumb drives in different safes. This trade-off\nbalances security with recovery convenience.\n\nUltimately, the design offers flexibility, allowing organizations to choose\ntheir preferred level of security while considering the operational impact of\ndisaster recovery.\nKey Management\n\nThe system assumes a long-lived, well-guarded, initial root key.\n\nThe root key will be periodically rotated, but still, it will be\nlong-lived.\n\n\nThe root key is automatically generated by SPIKE Bootstrap, and it’s\nnever stored on disk in plain text (i.e., it always lives in memory)\nAn administrator with adequate privileges can use spike recover to save\nShamir Shards in an encrypted medium out-of-band for future\nbreak-the-glass disaster recovery.\nRoot key rotation will also re-encrypt the secrets.\n\nRoot Key Properties\nPropertyValue\nSize32 bytes (256 bits)\nAlgorithmAES-256-GCM\nGenerationCryptographically secure random\nStorageMemory only (never persisted to disk)\nProtectionMutex-protected for thread-safe access\n\nWhy Memory-Only Storage?\nKeeping the root key exclusively in memory provides several security benefits:\n\nNo disk exposure: The key cannot be read from the filesystem\nEphemeral: The key is erased on process termination\nNo backup leakage: System backups do not contain the key\nReduced attack surface: Fewer persistence vectors to protect\n\nThe trade-off is that the key must be reconstructed on restart using Shamir\nshards from SPIKE Keepers, and in rare disaster scenarios, manual recovery\nmay be required.\nMemory Protection\nSPIKE components use mlockall() to prevent memory from being swapped to\ndisk. This is implemented via mem.Lock() from the SDK and called during\ncomponent initialization through Preamble().\nConfiguration requirements:\n\nLinux: Set memlock limits in /etc/security/limits.conf\nDocker: Configure default-ulimits.memlock in daemon.json\nKubernetes/systemd: Set LimitMEMLOCK=infinity in the unit file\n\nIf memory locking fails due to insufficient privileges, a warning is logged\n(controlled by SPIKE_SHOW_MEMORY_WARNING) and the system continues to operate.\nRecommended OS-level protections:\n\nEnable ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)\nEnable DEP (Data Execution Prevention)\nDisable swap (vm.swappiness=0)\nDisable core dumps (LimitCORE=0 or ulimit -c 0)\n\nRoot Key Rotation\nRoot key rotation is not currently supported. This is because:\n\nAll secrets and policies would need to be re-encrypted\nKeeper shards must be regenerated and redistributed\nThe migration process carries a risk of data loss\n\nThis is a known limitation and may be addressed in future versions.\nWorkload Access\nWorkloads can securely access their secrets and perform lifecycle operations\n(e.g., create, delete, and modify secrets) based on access policies defined\nby an administrator (using the spike policy command). These policies\nspecify what a workload is allowed to do with the secrets managed by\nSPIKE Nexus.\n\nDefault Deny: By default, access to SPIKE Nexus is prohibited. Only\nsuper administrators have full access by default.\nPolicy Enforcement: Workloads require a valid, explicitly defined policy\nto perform any lifecycle operation on paths that contain secrets.\nControlled Operations: The access policies strictly govern operations such\nas creating, deleting, or modifying secrets.\nAccess Scoping: Policies can define the scope and level of access (e.g.,\nread-only or full access) on specific secret paths for each workload.\n\nThis ensures that workloads only access or modify the secrets they are\nexplicitly permitted to, in accordance with their predefined policies.\nOperation Access Control Model\nSPIKE employs two distinct access control mechanisms depending on the\ncriticality of operations:\nPolicy-Controlled Operations\nMost operations are governed by SPIKE’s policy system, allowing flexible,\nfine-grained access control. Administrators can grant permissions to any\nworkload through policy configuration. These operations include:\n\nSecret Management: get, put, delete, undelete, list,\nmetadata\nPolicy Management: create, get, delete, list\nCipher Operations: encrypt, decrypt\nACL Operations: get, list\nBootstrap Operations: contribute, verify\n\nHard-Coded Restricted Operations\nRecovery and restoration operations are restricted exclusively to SPIKE\nPilot through hard-coded SPIFFE ID validation at the SDK level. These\noperations cannot be delegated through policies:\n\nRecovery (recover): Retrieves Shamir secret shards from SPIKE Keepers\nRestoration (restore): Submits shards to rebuild the root encryption\nkey\n\nRationale: Recovery operations bypass all policy controls and directly\nmanipulate root cryptographic material. If compromised, they could enable\ndecryption of all secrets in the system. Unlike other operations that work\nwithin the policy framework, recovery operations reconstruct the very key that\nprotects the policies themselves, creating a circular dependency that makes\npolicy-based control inappropriate.\nEnforcement: The SDK validates the caller’s SPIFFE ID using\nspiffeid.IsPilot() and fatally terminates any unauthorized attempts via\nlog.FatalErr(). This provides defense-in-depth alongside SPIKE Nexus’s own\nvalidation.\nSee Also: ADR-0029: Restrict Recovery and Restoration Operations to SPIKE\nPilot for detailed rationale and design\ndecisions.\nAdministrative Access\nAlthough SPIKE uses policy-based access to secrets and administrative\noperations, SPIKE Nexus recognizes certain builtin SPIFFE IDs and assigns\nthem predefined roles:\n\nAdministrative access is granted using special SPIFFE IDs:\n\nspiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/superuser: Super Admin. Can do\neverything but recovery or restore operations.\nspiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/recover: Recovery user. Can only\nrecover the root key shards to the local file system.\nspiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/restore: Restore user. Can only\nrestore the root key by providing one shard at a time.\n\n\n\nThis gives us the flexibility to have separate users own distinct operational\nresponsibilities. For example, a specific operator may only restore the system\nupon an unexpected crash, but they may not have the right to define access\npolicies for secrets.\nThis separation also provides better auditability.\n\nOnce the system is initialized, accidental re-initialization is prevented.\n\nFor emergencies the admin user can use an out-of-band script to\n“factory-reset” SPIKE.\n\n\n\nMulti-Admin Support\nOther than the three predefined roles (superuser, recover, restore), named\nadmin access to the system would only be possible using an external identity\nmanager such as an OIDC provider.\nSPIKE focuses on secure and efficient secret storage. It delegates access\nand identity management to established standards like OIDC, keeping\nauthentication concerns out of scope.\nSecurity of SPIKE Binaries\nSPIKE takes several measures to ensure the security of its binary\ndistributions:\n\nSymbol Stripping: Release binaries have symbols stripped to reduce attack\nsurface and minimize information leakage that could be used in exploitation\nattempts.\nCryptographic Verification: All official SPIKE releases include SHA256\nchecksums that users should verify before installation. This ensures the\nintegrity of the binaries and confirms they haven’t been tampered with during\ndistribution.\n\nVerification Process: Users can verify the integrity of downloaded\nbinaries using the following command: sha256sum -c spike-v$version.sha256.\nOr, on macOS: shasum -a 256 -c spike-v0.4.0.sha256.\n\n\nTransparency: All release artifacts and their corresponding checksums are\npublicly available on the official GitHub releases page,\nallowing for community verification and trust.\n\nFIPS Compliance\nFIPS stands for Federal Information Processing Standards. FIPS\nare publicly announced standards developed by the U.S. National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (NIST) for use in computer systems by\nnon-military American government agencies and government contractors.\nFIPS standards cover various aspects of information technology.\nFIPS 140-3, in particular, defines standards of security for hardware\nand software cryptographic modules used to protect sensitive information.\nAll SPIKE binaries are configured to be FIPS 140-3-enabled at compile\ntime.\nWe use GOFIPS140=v1.0.0 build time settings, that sets the\nGODEBUG=fips140=on flag which ensures that the Go runtime is in FIPS 140-3\nmode.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSPIKE System Overview\nSPIKE Security Model\nSPIKE Architectural Decision Records\n\n\n\nAbout\nCommunity\nGetting Started\nUsing SPIKE\nDeveloping SPIKE\nSPIKE Architecture\nTracking\nOperations\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/architecture/security-model/","title":"SPIKE Security Model"},"https://spike.ist/architecture/system-overview/":{"body":"SPIKE System Overview\nThis document provides an overview of SPIKE, a SPIFFE-native\nSecrets Management solution. It is designed to ensure secure storage, recovery,\nand management of sensitive data with a focus on simplicity, reliability,\nand scalability for production environments.\nSPIKE Components\nSPIKE (Secure Production Identity for Key Encryption) is a Secrets\nManager built on top of a SPIFFE (Secure Production\nIdentity Framework for Everyone) identity control plane, consisting of three\ncomponents:\n\nSPIKE Nexus (./nexus): The secrets store\nSPIKE Pilot (./spike): The CLI\nSPIKE Keeper (./keeper): The redundancy mechanism\nSPIKE Boostrap: (./bootstrap): Securely initializes SPIKE Nexus\nwith the required crypto material without human intervention.\n\nThe system provides high availability for secret storage with a manual recovery\nmechanism in case of irrecoverable failure.\nHere is an overview of each SPIKE component:\nSPIKE Nexus\n\nSPIKE Nexus is the primary component responsible for secrets management.\nIt creates and manages the root encryption key.\nIt handles secret encryption and decryption.\nIt syncs the root key’s Shamir Shards with SPIKE\nKeeperss. These shards then can be used to recover SPIKE Nexus\nupon a crash.\nIt provides an RESTful mTLS API for secret lifecycle management,\npolicy management, admin operations, and disaster recovery.\n\nSPIKE Keeper\n\nIt is designed to be simple and reliable.\nIt does one thing and does it well.\nIts only goal is to keep a Shamir Shard in memory.\nBy design, it does not have any knowledge about its peer SPIKE Keepers,\nnor SPIKE Nexus. It doesn’t require any configuration to be brought up.\nThis makes it simple to operate, replace, scale, replicate.\nIt enables automatic recovery if SPIKE Nexus crashes.\n\nSince SPIKE Keeper only contains a single shard, its compromise will not\ncompromise the system.\nThe more keepers you have, the more reliable and secure your SPIKE\ndeployment will be. We recommend 5 SPIKE Keeper instances with a\nshard-generation threshold of 3, for production deployments.\nCheck out SPIKE Production Hardening Guide for more\ndetails.\nSPIKE Pilot\n\nIt is the CLI to the system (i.e., the spike binary that you see\nin the examples).\nIt converts CLI commands to RESTful mTLS API calls to SPIKE Nexus.\n\nSPIKE Pilot is the only management entry point to the system.\nThus, deleting/disabling/removing SPIKE Pilot reduces the attack surface\nof the system since admin operations will not be possible without\nSPIKE Pilot.\nSimilarly, revoking the SPIRE Server registration of SPIKE Pilot’s\nSVID (once SPIKE Pilot is no longer needed) will effectively block\nadministrative access to the system, improving the overall security posture.\nSPIKE Bootstrap\n\nIt is a one-time initialization component that runs during system setup.\nIt generates a cryptographically secure random root key.\nIt splits the root key into Shamir shards and distributes them\nto the configured SPIKE Keeper instances.\nIt verifies that SPIKE Nexus has successfully initialized by performing\nan end-to-end encryption test.\n\nSPIKE Bootstrap is designed to run once per deployment. In Kubernetes\nenvironments, it uses a ConfigMap to track whether bootstrap has completed,\npreventing duplicate initialization. In bare-metal deployments, it runs each\ntime unless explicitly skipped.\nThis separation of concerns keeps SPIKE Nexus’s initialization flow simple:\nSPIKE Nexus always polls SPIKE Keepers for shards, while SPIKE\nBootstrap handles the initial key generation and distribution.\nIdentity Control Plane\nThe following diagram shows how SVIDs are assigned to SPIKE\ncomponents and other actors in the system. SVIDs, or SPIFFE-Verifiable\nIdentity Documents, are x.509 Digital Certificates, that contain\na SPIFFE ID in their SAN (Subject Alternative Name)\nThe following diagram illustrates how SPIFFE identities are distributed\nacross different SPIKE system components using SPIRE as the identity\ncontrol plane.\n\n\n    \n        \n        Establishing the Identity Control Plane.\n    \n\nIn a SPIKE deployment, SPIRE acts as the central authority that issues\nSVIDs to different workloads:\n\nApplications who need to manage secret lifecycles stored in SPIKE Nexus.\nSPIKE Infrastructure components:\n\nSPIKE Nexus\nSPIKE Pilot\nMultiple SPIKE Keeper instances\nSPIKE Bootstrap, to be executed once during system bootstrapping.\n\n\n\nEach component receives its own SVID, which serves as a\ncryptographically verifiable identity document. These SVIDs allow the\ncomponents to:\n\nProve their identity to other services\nEstablish secure, authenticated mTLS connections\nAccess resources they’re authorized to use\nCommunicate securely with other components in the system\n\nThe dashed boxes represent distinct security and deployment boundaries.\nSPIRE provides identity management capabilities that span across these\ntrust boundaries. This architecture allows administrative operations to be\nperformed on a hardened, secured SPIRE Server instance (shown in the top\nyellow box). This restricts direct access to sensitive operations\n(like creating SPIRE Server registration entries) from users and applications\nlocated in other trust boundaries.\n\nZero Trust FTW!\nThe approached described here is a common pattern in zero-trust\narchitectures, where every service needs to have a strong, verifiable\nidentity regardless of its network location.\nThis approach is more secure than traditional methods like shared secrets or\nnetwork-based security, as each workload gets its own unique, short-lived\nidentity that can be automatically rotated and revoked if needed.\n\nBuiltin SPIFFE IDs\nSPIKE Nexus recognizes the following builtin SPIFFE IDS:\n\nspiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/superuser: Super Admin\nspiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/recover: Recovery Admin\nspiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/restore: Restore Admin\n\nYou can check out the **Administrative Access section of SPIKE security\nmodel for more\ninformation about these roles.\nSPIKE Component Interaction\nThe following diagram depicts how various SPIKE components interact with\neach other:\n\n\n    \n        \n        Secret Management in SPIKE.\n    \n\nAt the top level, there’s an Application that consumes secrets through an\nmTLS (mutual TLS) connection to SPIKE Nexus. The application will likely use\nthe SPIKE Developer SDK to consume secrets without having\nto implement the underlying SPIFFE mTLS wiring.\nThe secrets are created/managed through:\nAn administrative user interacting with SPIKE Pilot through a command line\ninterface (the CLI is the spike binary itself).\nThen, SPIKE Pilot communicates with SPIKE Nexus over mTLS to create\nsecrets.\nSPIKE Nexus is the central management point for secrets. It’s our\nsecrets store.\nAt the bottom of the diagram, multiple SPIKE Keepers connect to\nSPIKE Nexus via mTLS. Each SPIKE Keeper holds a single\nShamir Secret Share (shard) of the root key that\nSPIKE Nexus maintains in memory.\nThis design ensures that compromising any individual SPIKE Keeper cannot\nbreach the system, as a single shard is not enough to reconstruct the\nroot key.\nThe system’s security can be tuned by configuring both the total number of\nSPIKE Keepers and the threshold of required shards needed to reconstruct\nthe root key.\nDuring system bootstrapping, SPIKE Nexus distributes these shards to the\nSPIKE Keepers. If SPIKE Nexus crashes or restarts, it automatically\nrecovers by requesting shards from a threshold number of healthy\nSPIKE Keepers to reconstruct the root key.\nThis mechanism provides automatic resiliency and redundancy without requiring\nmanual intervention or “unsealing” operations that are common in other secret\nmanagement solutions.\nThe system’s security and availability can be tuned by configuring both the\ntotal number of SPIKE Keepers and the threshold of required shards\nneeded to reconstruct the root key. This flexibility allows implementors to\nbalance their security requirements against operational needs–from basic\nredundancy to highly paranoid configurations requiring many SPIKE Keepers\nto be healthy.\nBoth the individual shards and the assembled root key are exclusively held in\nmemory and NEVER persisted to disk, forming a core aspect of SPIKE’s security\nmodel.\nThe system uses mTLS (mutual TLS) throughout for secure communication between\ncomponents, which ensures:\n\nAll communications are encrypted\nBoth sides of each connection authenticate each other\nThe system maintains a high level of security for secret management\n\nSPIKE Nexus Root Key Sharding\nThe following diagram shows how the SPIKE Nexus root key is split into\nshards and then delivered to SPIKE Keepers:\n\n\n    \n        \n        Secret Nexus root key sharding.\n    \n\nThe SPIKE Nexus has a root key that’s essential for encrypting the\nbacking store. This root key is split into Shamir shards based\non a configurable number and threshold. There should be as many keepers as\nthe created shards.\nThe key advantage of using Shamir sharding specifically (versus other forms\nof key splitting) is that it’s mathematically secure: The shards are\ncreated using polynomial interpolation, meaning:\n\nEach shard contains no meaningful information about the original key by itself\nYou need a threshold number of shards to reconstruct the key\nThe system can be configured to require any M of N shards to reconstruct the\nroot key (e.g., any 2 of 3, or 3 of 5, etc.)\n\nThis provides both security and fault tolerance: The system can continue\noperating even if some SPIKE Keepers become temporarily unavailable, as\nlong as the threshold number of shards remains accessible.\nSPIKE Bootstrap Flow\nThe following diagram depicts the SPIKE Bootstrap flow, where SPIKE\nKeepers receive their shards for SPIKE Nexus to use. Open the picture on a\nnew tab for an enlarged version of it.\n\n\n    \n        \n        SPIKE Bootstrap flow.\n    \n\nSPIKE Nexus Initial Bootstrapping\nThe following diagram depicts SPIKE Nexus initial bootstrapping flow.\n\n\n    \n        \n        SPIKE Nexus initialization.\n    \n\nWhen SPIKE Nexus is configured to use an in-memory backing store, we\ndon’t need SPIKE Keepers because the database is in SPIKE Nexus’s memory\nand there is nothing to recover if SPIKE Nexus crashes. This is a convenient\nsetup to use for development purposes.\nWhen SPIKE Nexus is configured to use a persistent backing store (like\nSQLite), it does not generate the root key itself. Instead, SPIKE Nexus\nalways polls SPIKE Keepers to collect enough shards to reconstruct the\nroot key. This polling continues indefinitely until the threshold number of\nshards is collected.\nThe root key is generated by a separate component: SPIKE Bootstrap.\nWhen SPIKE Bootstrap runs, it generates a secure random root key, splits\nit into Shamir shards, and distributes those shards to the\nconfigured SPIKE Keeper instances. This separation of concerns keeps\nSPIKE Nexus’s initialization flow simple and predictable.\nSPIKE Nexus Updating SPIKE Keepers\nIn addition, there is an ongoing operation that runs as a separate goroutine\ninside SPIKE Nexus:\n\nAt regular intervals, if SPIKE Nexus has a root key, it computes\nShamir shards and dispatches them to the SPIKE Keepers.\nThis ensures that the shards remain synchronized even if individual\nSPIKE Keepers restart.\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        SPIKE Nexus updating SPIKE Keepers.\n    \n\nThis flow establishes a secure boot process: SPIKE Bootstrap handles the\ninitial key generation and distribution, while SPIKE Nexus focuses solely\non recovering the root key from SPIKE Keepers whenever it starts.\nThe following state diagram illustrates how each of these recovery and\nrestoration steps relate to the existence of the root key* in memory.\n\n\n    \n        \n        SPIKE Nexus Root Key state diagram.\n    \n\nSPIKE “break-the-glass” Disaster Recovery\nThere is one edge case, though: When there is a total system crash, and SPIKE\nKeepers don’t have any shards in their memory, then you’ll need a manual\nrecovery.\nThis event is highly unlikely, as deploying a sufficient number of SPIKE\nKeepers with proper geographic distribution significantly reduces the\nprobability of them all crashing simultaneously. Since SPIKE Keepers are\ndesigned to operate independently and without requiring intercommunication,\nfailures caused by systemic issues are minimized. By ensuring redundancy across\ndiverse geographic locations, even large-scale outages or localized failures are\nhighly improbable to impact all SPIKE Keepers at once.\nThat being said, unexpected failures can occur, and the disaster recovery\nprocedure for these situations.\n\nNeed a Runbook?\nThe SPIKE Recovery Procedures page contains\nstep-by-step instructions to follow during, before, and a disaster occurs.\nYou will need to prepare beforehand so that you can recover the root\nkey when the system fails to automatically recover it from SPIKE Keepers.\n\nThe following diagram outlines creating recovery shards for SPIKE Nexus\nbefore a disaster strikes, while the system is healthy. The operator leverages\nspike operator recover command to create the shards. You can open the picture\non a new tab for an enlarged version of it.\n\n\n    \n        \n        SPIKE Manual disaster recovery flow.\n    \n\nAnd the following diagram outlines how you can use spike operator restore\ncommand to restore SPIKE Nexus back to its working state after a disaster.\nYou can open the picture on a new tab for an enlarged version of it.\n\n\n    \n        \n        SPIKE Nexus manual restoration flow.\n    \n\nPreventive Backup\n\nRun spike recover as Soon as You Can\nYou must back up the root key shards using spike recover BEFORE a\ndisaster strikes.\nThis is like having a spare key stored in a safe place before you lose your\nmain keys. Without this proactive backup step, there would be nothing to\nrecover from in a catastrophic failure.\n\nThis operation needs to be done BEFORE any disaster; ideally, shortly after\ndeploying SPIKE.\nHere is how the flow goes:\n\nThe Operator runs spike recover using SPIKE Pilot.\nSPIKE Pilot saves the recovery shards on the home directory of the system/\nThe Operator encrypts and stores these shards in a secure medium, and securely\nerases the copies generated as an output to spike recover.\n\nWhen later recovery is needed, the Operator will provide these shards to\nSPIKE to restore the system back to its working state.\nDisaster Recovery\nWhen disaster strikes:\n\nSPIKE Nexus and SPIKE Keepers have simultaneously crashed and restarted.\nSPIKE Nexus has lost its root key.\nSPIKE Keepers don’t have enough shards.\nThus, automatic recovery is impossible and the system requires manual\nrecovery.\n\nIn that case, the Operator uses spike restore to provide the previously\nbacked-up shards one at a time\n\nSPIKE Pilot forwards the entered shard to SPIKE Nexus\nSystem acknowledges and tracks the progress of shard restoration, returning\nthe number of shards received, and the number of shards remaining to restore\nthe root key.\n\nSystem Restoration\nOnce enough shards are provided, SPIKE Nexus reconstructs the root key.\nA separate goroutine redistributes shards to SPIKE Keepers and the System\nreturns to normal operation.\nWant More Pretty Pictures?\nThe diagrams above have been simplified for clarity.

It also demonstrates how communications between SPIKE\nKeepers and SPIKE Nexus are secured using SPIFFE-based mTLS to ensure\nauthenticated, encrypted transport.\nSecure SPIKE Deployment: Integrating SPIRE with an Isolated Management\nCluster:\nIn this demo, the presenter shows how to deploy SPIKE in a management cluster\nthat is isolated from workload clusters, integrating SPIRE to issue identities\nand enforce trust boundaries.\nCross-Cluster Secrets Federation with SPIFFE and\nSPIKE:\nHere, the focus is on federating secrets across multiple clusters, allowing\nworkloads in different clusters to access shared secrets securely. The demo\nshows how SPIKE can bridge trust boundaries using SPIFFE identities and\nsecret federation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nHello Universe\nContact Us\nPresentations and Demos\n\n\n\nAbout\nCommunity\nGetting Started\nUsing SPIKE\nDeveloping SPIKE\nSPIKE Architecture\nTracking\nOperations\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/community/presentations/","title":"Presentations and Demos"},"https://spike.ist/community/resources/":{"body":"Resources\nSource Code\n\nSPIKE on GitHub\nSPIKE Go SDK on GitHub\n\nAPI Documentation\n\nSPIKE API Documentation\nSPIKE Go SDK API Documentation\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nHello Universe\nContact Us\nPresentations and Demos\n\n\n\nAbout\nCommunity\nGetting Started\nUsing SPIKE\nDeveloping SPIKE\nSPIKE Architecture\nTracking\nOperations\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/community/resources/","title":"Resources"},"https://spike.ist/development/":{"body":"Development\n\nDeploying SPIKE Locally\nSPIKE on Linux\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/development/","title":"Developing SPIKE"},"https://spike.ist/development/api-docs/":{"body":"API Documentation\nThe public Go API documentation for SPIKE and the SPIKE Go SDK is available on\npkg.go.dev:\n\nSPIKE API Documentation\nSPIKE Go SDK API Documentation\n\nSource Code\nThe source code for SPIKE and the SPIKE Go SDK is available on GitHub:\n\nSPIKE on GitHub\nSPIKE Go SDK on GitHub\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nDeploying SPIKE Locally\nSPIKE on Linux\n\n\n\nAbout\nCommunity\nGetting Started\nUsing SPIKE\nDeveloping SPIKE\nSPIKE Architecture\nTracking\nOperations\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/development/api-docs/","title":"API Documentation"},"https://spike.ist/development/bare-metal/":{"body":"SPIKE on Linux\nIn this guide, you will learn how to build, deploy, and test SPIKE\nfrom the source. This guide assumes basic familiarity with terminal commands and\nthe ability to install and execute the required software. It is recommended to\nhave administrative privileges on your system, as some steps might require them.\nThe tools and resources mentioned in this guide are essential for building and\nworking with SPIKE effectively. Make sure to follow each step carefully to\nensure a smooth experience. In case you encounter issues, please discuss\nthem on the SPIFFE community Slack.\nEnvironment Variables\nIt may be useful to set the following environment variables before\nyou start.\nThis is a sample configuration; please adjust as needed:\n\nPrerequisites\nThis quickstart guide assumes you are using an Ubuntu Linux operating\nsystem. The steps may slightly differ if you are using a different operating\nsystem.\nSPIKE can run anywhere SPIFFE can be deployed. For consistency,\nthe tutorials and guides in SPIKE documentation use Ubuntu as\nthe base operating system. Though, if you encounter issues with your OS, feel\nfree to discuss them on the SPIFFE community Slack.\nHere are the OS details that we are testing this guide on:\n\nIn addition, you will need the usual suspects:\n\ngit\nmake\ngo (the most recent version would do)\nnode ((optional: most AI tools require it)\nbuild-essential\n(i.e., sudo apt install build-essential)\n(Optional) [zola])zola, if you want to build the documentation site\nlocally\n\nGo Environment Setup\nHere’s part of the go env setting we use for this guide. Yours might slightly\nvary depending on your development configuration.\nThe environment setup shown below is mostly what Go uses by default, yet, we\nprovide them just-in-case to eliminate any environment-related setup issues you\nmight face.\n\nIf you need, you can also use Go’s built-in tooling to view and modify your Go\nenvironment settings. Use the go env command to inspect or set specific\nenvironment variables.\nFor example:\n\nThese changes made using the go env -w command are persistent and stored in\nGo configuration files. You can view these changes in the file located at\n$(go env GOENV). To reset a variable to its default value, use:\n\nBuilding SPIRE\nTo get started, let’s create a development version of SPIRE.\nNote that this is not a production-ready setup. For production, you should\nfollow the official SPIRE documentation.\nLet’s first build SPIRE from the source:\n\nAdding SPIRE Binaries to $PATH\nAdd the SPIRE binaries to your $PATH:\n\nAdding SPIKE Binaries to $PATH\nThe bare-metal installation will create SPIKE binaries in the project\nroot directory by default. You can add the binaries to your $PATH as follows:\n\nAdditionally, you can source the following file to define additional\nSPIKE-related environment variables for your convenience. This is NOT\nrequired because if you don’t define them, SPIKE will assume sensible\ndefaults.\nSourcing ./hack/lib/env.sh allows you to override the default SPIKE\nenvironment settings. This can be particularly useful for development\npurposes to test custom setups or alternative paths.\nHaving all overrides in a single place is also handy as it doubles\nas documentation to help understand the development environment.\n\nVerifying SPIRE Installation\nVerify SPIRE installation as follows:\n\nOutput:\n\nBuilding SPIKE\nNext, build SPIKE binaries:\n\nConfigure Local DNS\nThe default agent configuration file uses\nspire.spike.ist as the SPIRE Server DNS name. To resolve this name to the\nloopback address, add the following entry to your /etc/hosts file:\n\nStarting SPIKE\nThere is a starter script that combines and automates some steps in the\nfollowing sections. It configures and runs SPIRE Server, SPIRE Agent,\nSPIKE Nexus, and SPIKE Keeper.\nYou can run this to start all the required components:\n\n\nmake start Is Also a Mini Smoke Test\nThe make start script also runs sample secret and policy operations to\nensure everything is working as expected. So, although it is not strictly\nnecessary, you are encouraged to run it once before starting development\nto ensure everything is working as expected.\n\nAnd then, on a separate terminal, you can run spike:\n\n\nKilling the make start Process Will Exit Cleanly\nWhen you stop the make start script by CTRLT+C, it will exit cleanly;\nduring this process, it will also kill all the running SPIKE and SPIKE\ncomponents.\nHowever, in certain cases, especially if the script has not run successfully\nto the end, it might leave some processes running in the background.\nIn such cases, you can kill the processes manually by running:\n\n\nAlthough the make start script is convenient, it might be useful to run the\ncomponents individually to understand the process better and debug any issues\nthat might arise.\nThe following sections will guide you through the individual steps.\n\nCLI Reference\nOne of the best ways to get the most up-to-date information about the spike\nCLI is to run spike --help or spike [command] --help.\nAdditionally, you can check out the SPIKE CLI\nDocumentation for a more detailed reference with sample commands\nand examples.\nThere are also demo recordings that showcase the SPIKE CLI in\naction.\n\nStart SPIRE Server\nStart the SPIRE Server:\n\nCreating Registration Entries\nThe following script will create registration entries for the SPIKE components:\n\nStart SPIRE Agent\nStart the SPIRE Agent:\n\nStart SPIKE Components\nThen start SPIKE components:\nMake sure you started the following binaries, each runs on a specific terminal\nwindow.\nStart the workloads:\n\nHere is how one of these SPIKE Keeper startup scripts:\n\nAnd here is how SPIKE Nexus startup script:\n\nBootstrap SPIKE\nBefore using SPIKE you need to bootstrap it with a root key.\nFor that, execute the following:\n\nUsing SPIKE Pilot\nDefine an alias to SPIKE Pilot:\n\nRun SPIKE Pilot and explore the CLI:\n\nTesting Out SPIKE\nLet’s test SPIKE by creating a secret:\n\nNow, let’s read the secret back:\n\nLet’s delete the secret now:\n\nIf you try to read the secret again, you won’t be able to get it.\nFeel free to experiment with other SPIKE commands in your sandbox\nenvironment to explore its capabilities and better understand how it works. This\nis a great way to familiarize yourself with its features and test various\nscenarios safely.\nUninstalling SPIKE\nRetaining the SPIKE binaries on your system poses no issues. These binaries\nare compact, consuming minimal disk space and no resources when inactive. As\nsimple executable files, they have no impact on your system’s performance when\nnot in use. Therefore, keeping them installed is completely harmless.\nHowever, if you want to wipe everything out, you can remove the binaries\nand SPIKE’s data folder, and that would be it:\n\nIf you have spire-server and spire-agent on your system, and you are not\nusing them for anything else; you can remove them too:\n\nHave Fun\nThat’s about it.\nEnjoy.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nDeploying SPIKE Locally\nSPIKE on Linux\n\n\n\nAbout\nCommunity\nGetting Started\nUsing SPIKE\nDeveloping SPIKE\nSPIKE Architecture\nTracking\nOperations\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/development/bare-metal/","title":"SPIKE on Linux"},"https://spike.ist/development/local-deployment/":{"body":"Building SPIKE Locally and Deploying to Minikube\nIf you want to contribute to the SPIKE codebase and test your changes on a\nlocal Kubernetes cluster, follow this guide.

This limit\nis imposed by WSL’s Relay process before any Linux configuration is read, which\nmeans standard Linux approaches (/etc/security/limits.conf, systemd\nconfigs, PAM) cannot override it.\nSPIKE uses memory locking (mlock) to prevent sensitive secrets from being\nswapped to disk. Failing to lock memory will not stop SPIKE from running,\nbut you will see warnings in the logs.\nWSL spawns your shell via a Windows-side Relay process:\n\nBy the time Linux session management runs, the limit is already inherited.\nThe following have no effect on interactive WSL shells:\n\n/etc/security/limits.conf\n/etc/systemd/user.conf\n/etc/systemd/system.conf\nPAM configuration\n\nThese configs do apply to processes spawned through systemd\n(e.g., systemd-run --user), but not to your default terminal session.\nTo fix this, you can use the following script:\n\nYou can even add this script to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc to make it\nautomatically run on every shell session.\nEnvironment Variables\nIt may be useful to set the following environment variables before\nyou start.\nThis is a sample configuration; please adjust as needed:\n\nStarting Minikube\nTo start a local Minikube cluster, clone the project repository and run the\nfollowing command in the root directory of the project:\n\nIf successful, you will have a local Minikube cluster running with the\nnecessary plugins enabled.

But even the most\nreliable systems need comprehensive backup and recovery plans. This guide\nexplains how to properly back up, secure, and restore SPIKE deployments—ensuring\nyour critical secrets infrastructure remains resilient against catastrophic\nfailures.\nArchitecture Foundations for Effective Backup Planning\nSPIKE consists of three critical components, each requiring specific backup\nconsiderations:\n\n\nSPIKE Nexus: The central component handling secret encryption/decryption\nand root key management. It stores encrypted secrets in a SQLite database\nand communicates via an mTLS API.\n\n\nSPIKE Keeper: A redundancy mechanism holding Shamir Secret Sharing shards\nof the root key in memory. Multiple Keeper instances provide resiliency,\nrequiring a configurable threshold of shards to reconstruct the root key.\n\n\nSPIKE Pilot: The CLI interface that translates administrative commands\ninto mTLS API calls to SPIKE Nexus.\n\n\nThe foundation of SPIKE’s security model lies in its root key management:\n\nThe root key encrypts all data in the backing store and never exists\non disk in plaintext\nThe system splits the root key into multiple Shamir shards based on a\nconfigurable threshold (e.g., any 2 of 3 or 3 of 5 shards needed to\nreconstruct)\nSPIKE Keepers hold these shards in memory for automatic recovery if\nSPIKE Nexus crashes\nFor disaster recovery scenarios, administrators can create additional recovery\nshards\n\nBackup procedures\nSQLite database backup\nThe SPIKE Nexus uses a SQLite database to store all encrypted secrets and\nmetadata. This database is typically located in ~/.spike on the Nexus server.\n\nImportant considerations:\n\nThe SQLite database backup contains encrypted data that can only be decrypted\nwith the root key\nUse database-level locking through SQLite’s .backup command rather than\ndirect file copying\n\nRoot key and cryptographic material backup\nThe root key is SPIKE’s most critical component. While it exists only in\nmemory during normal operation, you must back it up for disaster recovery using\nShamir’s Secret Sharing:\n\nSecure handling of recovery shards:\n\nEncrypt each shard immediately after creation (e.g., using GPG with\nhardware keys)\nStore encrypted shards in separate secure locations\nConsider using HSMs or smart cards for shard storage\nImplement strict access controls for shard access\nDocument the threshold configuration (e.g., “2 of 3 shards required”)\n\nConfiguration and other components backup\nBeyond the database and root key, back up these critical components:\n\n\nSPIRE Server and SPIRE Agent configuration.\n\n\nSPIFFE registration entries:\n\n\n\nRestore procedures\nPrerequisites for Restoration\nBefore beginning any restore operation, ensure:\n\n\nYou have all necessary components:\n\nSQLite database backup\nAccess to the required number of recovery shards (meeting your threshold)\nSPIFFE/SPIRE configuration backups\n\n\n\nYou have the appropriate SPIFFE identity for restoration:\n\nRequired SPIFFE ID: spiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/restore\n\n\n\nAll SPIKE services are properly installed on the target system\n\n\nRoot key restoration\nIf both SPIKE Nexus and all SPIKE Keepers are unavailable\n(catastrophic failure), follow this procedure:\n\nSPIKE Nexus will:\n\nAutomatically reconstruct the root key from the provided shards\nRedistribute shards to available SPIKE Keeper instances\nResume normal operation with the restored key\n\nSQLite database restoration\nTo restore the SQLite database:\n\n\nStop SPIKE Nexus.\n\n\nReplace the current database with the backup.\n\n\n\nSet appropriate permissions\n\n\n\nStart SPIKE Nexus\n\n\nNote: After restoring the database, if SPIKE Nexus cannot automatically\nrecover the root key from SPIKE Keepers, you’ll need to perform the root\nkey restoration procedure above.\nVerification procedures\nAfter completing a restore operation, verify system integrity:\n\nBackup best practices\nBackup frequency and scheduling\nComponentRecommended FrequencyReasoning\nSQLite DatabaseDailyCaptures secret changes promptly\nRoot Key ShardsAfter initial setup and after any root key rotationCritical security component\nConfigurationAfter any configuration changeEnsures you can recreate the environment\nSPIFFE EntriesAfter any identity changesRequired for workload authentication\n\nBackup rotation and retention\nImplement a comprehensive retention policy:\n\nShort-term backups: Keep daily backups for 14 days\nMedium-term backups: Keep weekly backups for 3 months\nLong-term backups: Keep monthly backups for 1 year\n\n\nTest Your Backup Integrity\nA backup that does not work when you need most is not a backup.\nMake sure you validate the integrity and efficacy of your backups\nregularly.\n\nSecure Storage Recommendations\nFor root key recovery shards:\n\nMulti-level security: Encrypt shards before storage\nPhysical separation: Store shards in different physical locations\nAccess controls: Implement strict controls with separation of duties\nHardware security: Consider HSMs or smart cards for shard storage\nEnvironmental protection: Use fire/water-resistant safes for physical media\n\nFor database backups:\n\nEncryption: Implement at-rest encryption for all backup files\nAccess limitations: Restrict backup access to authorized personnel only\nImmutability: Consider WORM (Write Once Read Many) storage for critical backups\nOffline copies: Maintain air-gapped copies of critical backups\n\nMigration Limitations and Planning\nWhile SPIKE currently lacks built-in migration tools, careful planning can\nfacilitate future migrations.\nCurrent migration limitations\n\nNo direct database migration between different SPIKE versions\nManual coordination is required for root key transfers\n\nConclusion\nA comprehensive backup and restore strategy is essential for maintaining the\nresilience of your SPIKE deployment. By following the procedures in this\nguide, you can ensure that even in catastrophic failure scenarios, your secrets\nmanagement infrastructure can be rapidly restored with minimal data loss.\nRemember these key principles:\n\nRegular backups: Automated, validated, and securely stored\nRoot key protection: The foundation of your security model\nTested procedures: Verify your restore process works before you need it\nDocumentation: Keep clear records of all configurations and procedures\n\nBy implementing these practices, your DevOps team will be prepared to handle\nany recovery scenario while maintaining the security guarantees that make\nSPIKE an effective secrets management solution.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSPIKE Cross-Platform Build\nSPIKE Production Setup\nSPIKE Recovery Procedures\nSPIKE Release Management\n\n\n\nAbout\nCommunity\nGetting Started\nUsing SPIKE\nDeveloping SPIKE\nSPIKE Architecture\nTracking\nOperations\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/operations/backup/","title":"SPIKE Backup and Restore"},"https://spike.ist/operations/build/":{"body":"Cross-Building SPIKE Binaries\nWe cross-build SPIKE on an ARM64 Mac Machine.\nHere is what’s needed for a cross-compile:\nPrerequisites\nInstalled required tools via Homebrew.\n\nBuild\nTo cross-compile the binaries, run the following:\n\nAfter the script runs to completion, you should get the following artifacts:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSPIKE Cross-Platform Build\nSPIKE Production Setup\nSPIKE Recovery Procedures\nSPIKE Release Management\n\n\n\nAbout\nCommunity\nGetting Started\nUsing SPIKE\nDeveloping SPIKE\nSPIKE Architecture\nTracking\nOperations\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/operations/build/","title":"SPIKE Cross-Platform Build"},"https://spike.ist/operations/production/":{"body":"SPIKE Production Setup Guide\nThis guide involves configuring the necessary environment, deploying the\napplication with optimized settings, and ensuring scalability, reliability, and\nsecurity for a seamless production experience.\nBaseline recommendations\nDo Not Run as Root\nFor SPIKE components use an unprivileged service account, rather than\nrunning as the root or Administrator account. SPIKE is designed to run as\nan unprivileged user, and doing so adds significant defense against various\nprivilege-escalation attacks.\nAllow Minimal Write Privilege\nSPIKE Nexus only needs writes access to its backing store. It’s a good\npractice to limit what is writable by the SPIKE Nexus process to just\nthe directories and files of the backing store.\nDisable Swap\nSPIKE encrypts data in transit and at rest; however, it must still have\nsensitive data in memory to function. The risk of exposure should be minimized\nby disabling swap to prevent the operating system from paging sensitive data to\ndisk.\nDisable Core Dumps\nA user or administrator that can force a core dump and has access to the\nresulting file can potentially access SPIKE’s root key and other\ncryptographically sensitive material encryption keys. Preventing core dumps is\na platform-specific process; on Linux setting the resource limit RLIMIT_CORE\nto 0 disables core dumps. In the systemd service unit file, setting\nLimitCORE=0 will enforce this setting for the Vault service.\nMemory Protection\nSPIKE uses memory locking to prevent memory from being swapped to disk. This\nensures that the memory is not accessible to an attacker who has access to the\nsystem.\nSPIKE tries to mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE), it tries to lock:\n\nAll currently allocated memory\nAll future memory allocations\n\nSo if the user running the SPIKE components does not have enough limits,\nthis attempt will fail.\nTo enable memory locking, you may need to modify the ulimit settings for the\nuser running SPIKE components.\nFor bare-metal Linux deployments, edit the /etc/security/limits.conf file to\nadd the following lines:\n\nFor Docker, edit or create the /etc/docker/daemon.json file and add the\nfollowing—The instructions may differ for other container runtimes:\n\nFor Kubernetes, the settings will depend on your container runtime.\nFor containerd, for example, execute the following:\n\nIf, for any reason, you cannot enable memory locking, make sure to disable\nswap and core dumps on your system for additional security.\nNetwork Security\nAlthough SPIKE relies on Zero Trust networking principles and establishes\nmTLS everywhere, that does not mean perimeter defense is unimportant.\nUse a local firewall for SPIRE Server, SPIKE Nexus, and SPIKE Keeper\ninstances, or relevant features of your cloud provider to restrict incoming and\noutgoing traffic to the bare minimum that you need.\nDisable Shell Command History\nYou may want the spike commands themselves not appear in history at all.\nKeep a Frequent Upgrade Cadence\nSPIKE is actively developed, hardened, and patched against vulnerabilities.\nYou should upgrade SPIKE frequently to incorporate security fixes and any\nchanges in default settings such as key lengths or cipher suites.\nRestrict Backing Store Access\nSPIKE encrypts data at rest, regardless of the kind of backing store it\nuses. Although SPIKE encrypts the data, an attacker with arbitrary\ncontrol can cause data corruption or loss by modifying or deleting keys.\nYou should restrict storage access outside SPIKE Nexus to avoid\nunauthorized access or operations.\nAlso, when using an external data store, although SPIKE assumes the store is\nuntrusted, yet, still, considering the following is important:\n\nIf this is a shared database with other services, who else has access to it\nand manages it?\nHow will SPIKE authenticate to the database?\nDoes the database connection allow TLS-protected secure communication?\n\nConfigure SELinux / AppArmor\nUsing mechanisms like SELinux and AppArmor can help you gain layers of\nsecurity when using SPIKE. While SPIKE can run on several popular\noperating systems, Linux is recommended due to the various security primitives\nand memory governance.\nContainer Considerations\nSPIKE uses memory locking when possible. To use memory locking (mlock)\ninside a SPIKE container, you need to use the overlayfs2 or another\nsupporting driver.\nLogging Considerations\nLike all systems, logging is an essential part of SPIKE. However, logs\nproduced by SPIKE components also function as evidence for audits and\nsecurity incidents.\nCurrently, we don’t separate audit logs from event logs. Audit logs are clearly\nidentified by the prefix [AUDIT]: at the beginning of each entry.\n\nFuture Goals\nWe have action items to separate audit logs from regular logs and redirect\nthem to a configurable list of audit targets. For now, they remain part of\nthe standard output stream of the application.\n\nSince logs may serve as evidence, consider these important factors when\nimplementing a logging solution:\n\nRetention periods should comply with your organization’s legal requirements\nThe logging system should maintain high availability for both log intake and\nstorage\nLogs should be tamper-proof with verifiable integrity\nThe system should maintain and document a proper chain of custody\n\nHardening SPIRE\nSPIKE leverages SPIFFE and SPIRE as its identity control plane to\nmanage cryptographic workload identities securely and efficiently. SPIRE\nis an implementation of the SPIFFE specification, providing a robust\nframework for workload attestation and cryptographic identity issuance within\ndistributed systems.\nConfiguring SPIRE for production is critical to ensure the security and\nreliability of SPIKE. An improperly configured SPIRE deployment can leave\ngaps in the identity management process, potentially exposing sensitive\ncryptographic operations to unauthorized access.\nHere are some key steps to harden SPIRE for production:\nIsolate SPIRE Server\nThe SPIRE Server can run completely in Kubernetes, alongside other pods and\napplications.\nHowever, it is a good security practice to run the SPIRE Server on a\nseparate dedicated Kubernetes cluster, or on standalone hardware. This way, if\nthe primary cluster is compromised, the SPIRE private keys are not at risk.\nTo protect SPIRE private keys even further, you can use one of the\nsupported SPIRE KMS plugins.\nSecure SPIRE Server and Agent Communication\n\nUse mutual TLS (mTLS) for all communication between SPIRE Server, SPIRE\nAgents, and workloads.\nConfigure SPIRE Server and Agents to only accept connections from trusted\nsources.\n\nSet Up Attestation Policies\n\nDefine strict attestation policies to ensure that only trusted workloads are\nissued SPIFFE IDs. // TODO: explain what that means in the context of SPIKE.\nUtilize the node attestation plugins (e.g., AWS IID, Kubernetes) to verify\nthe identity of nodes running SPIRE Agents.\n\nLimit Permissions\n\nRun SPIRE Server and Agents with the minimum required permissions.\nUse dedicated non-root users for running SPIRE processes.\n\nSecure SPIRE Database\nIf the SPIRE Server is configured to use an external database for\npersistence, ensure that the database is:\n\nEncrypted at rest and in transit.\nRestricted to access only from SPIRE Server.\n\nConfigure Registration Entries\n\nCreate granular SPIFFE ID registration entries for specific workloads.\nAvoid using wildcard matching in selectors to reduce the risk of impersonation\nattacks.\n\nYou can find sample scripts that creates registration entries under the\n./hack folder:\n\n./hack/bare-metal/entry/spire-server-entry-recover-register.sh\n./hack/bare-metal/entry/spire-server-entry-spike-register.sh\n./hack/bare-metal/entry/spire-server-entry-restore-register.sh\n\nHarden SPIRE Deployment on Kubernetes\nIf you have deployed SPIRE on Kubernetes:\n\nUse Kubernetes Pod Security Standards, Network Policies,\nand RBAC to restrict SPIRE Server and SPIRE Agent access.\nLimit SPIRE components to trusted namespaces and nodes.\n\nRegularly Rotate Certificates\n\nConfigure SPIRE to rotate workload certificates and keys frequently.\nAutomate the process to ensure timely certificate renewal without manual\nintervention.\n\nEnable Logging and Monitoring\n\nConfigure logging for SPIRE Server and Agents to capture suspicious\nactivity.\nMonitor logs for failed authentication attempts, unauthorized access, or\nother anomalies.\n\nPerform Regular Audits\n\nConduct regular security audits and penetration tests on the SPIRE deployment.\nReview registration entries and attestation policies to ensure they align\nwith security best practices.\n\nUpdate SPIRE Regularly\n\nKeep SPIRE updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security\npatches and new features.\n\nBy carefully configuring and hardening SPIRE, you ensure that\nSPIKE’s SPIFFE-based identity control plane is robust, reliable, and\nsecured against potential threats, forming the foundation for SPIKE’s secure\noperations in production environments.\nIsolate SPIRE Server\nYou are encouraged to isolate the SPIRE Server from other SPIKE components.\nBy doing this, a separate administrator can access the SPIRE Server and\ncreate SPIKE registration entries, whereas other SPIKE users, including\nthe SPIKE Pilot superadmin, will not be able to create SPIRE Server\nregistration entries.\nThis approach aligns with zero-trustbest practices by enforcing separation\nof privileges and reducing the risk of privilege misuse or escalation.\nFor bare-metal or VM deployments, it is recommended to run the\nSPIRE Server on its own dedicated machine, separate from SPIKE Keeper\nand SPIKE Nexus machines. This ensures that any compromise of those\nmachines does not directly impact the SPIRE Server.\nFor Kubernetes deployments, it is a good practice to run the SPIRE\nServer outside the Kubernetes cluster on an ultra-hardened system. This\nprotects the SPIRE Server from potential security breaches or privilege\nescalations within the Kubernetes cluster.\nSPIKE General Hardening Guidelines\nThe guidelines covered in this section apply to all SPIKE components,\nincluding SPIKE Nexus, SPIKE Keeper, and SPIKE Pilot.\nSingle Tenancy\nSPIKE Nexus is recommended to be the only main process running on a machine.\nThis reduces the risk that another process running on the same\nmachine is compromised and can interact with SPIKE Nexus.\nIn a Kubernetes deployment, you can achieve this by setting up appropriate\nNode affinity rules.\nUser Privileges\n\nFor bare-metal deployments:\n\nRun SPIKE Nexus and SPIKE Keeper processes as non-root users.\nConfigure them to have minimal permissions.\nKeep OS and security packages up to date.\n\n\nFor Kubernetes deployments:\n\nDisable privilege escalation for containers by setting\nallowPrivilegeEscalation: false in your PodSecurity configuration.\nUse Kubernetes Pod Security Admission or equivalent policies to enforce\nsecurity constraints.\nLimit the use of privileged containers (privileged: false) wherever\nfeasible.\nConfigure strict NetworkPolicies to restrict communication between Pods.\nAlways use read-only root filesystems for the containers\n(readOnlyRootFilesystem: true).\nSpecify non-root runAsUser and runAsGroup in the container’s\nsecurity context—Do not run the container as root.\n\n\nFor Docker deployments:\n\nPrevent containers from running in privileged mode using the\n--privileged=false option.\nUse --read-only to enforce read-only filesystem access for the container.\nLimit container capabilities by setting the --cap-drop option to drop all\nunnecessary capabilities.\nAvoid mapping the Docker socket into containers for security-sensitive\nworkloads.\nImplement user namespaces with --userns-remap to isolate containers from\nthe host’s root user.\n\n\n\nSecurity Modules\n\nFor Linux bare-metal SPIKE installations, consider enabling and\nconfiguring AppArmor and SELinux.\nSet up mandatory access control.\nEnforce strict process isolation.\n\nNetwork Security\n\nRestrict network access to essential ports/protocols.\nImplement network segmentation.\nConfigure strict firewall rules.\nConduct regular network security audits.\n\nLogging and Monitoring\n\nSet up a comprehensive process logging mechanism\nMonitor for unauthorized access attempts\nImplement real-time alerting\nRegular log analysis and review\n\nSecurity Auditing\n\nRegular system configuration audits\nSecurity control effectiveness reviews\nPeriodic penetration testing\nConfiguration compliance checks\n\nBinary Integrity\nOfficial SPIKE binaries are published with SHA-256 checksums. Make sure\nyou implement SHA hash verification when using SPIKE distributions to\nensure that you are using original, tested, validated, and approved binaries.\nIn addition, it’s useful to have regular binary integrity checks too, to ensure\nthat binaries are not replaced with malicious code.\nOne more thing you are encouraged to do is to include SPIKE Nexus,\nSPIKE Keeper, and SPIKE Pilot’s binary SHA hashes while registering\nthem to SPIRE Server. Here’s an example:\n\nThis way, if the binary changes, SPIRE Server will not assign it an SVID,\nand the rest of the system will not trust it and stop communicating with it,\neffectively securing the SPIKE components by totally isolating and\nkeeping out the untrusted binary.\nDefense in Depth\n\nImplement multiple layers of security controls.\nHave regular security control reviews.\nHave comprehensive security documentation.\n\nHow the Root Key Is Protected in SPIKE\nIn SPIKE, the root key is essential for encrypting secrets within the\ncentral store, SPIKE Nexus. To prevent any single entity from having full\naccess to this key, SPIKE uses Shamir’s Secret Sharing to divide the\nroot key into multiple shares. These shares are distributed among\nSPIKE Keepers, ensuring that the root key can only be reconstructed when a\nsufficient number of shares are combined.\nThis approach enhances security by requiring collaboration among multiple\ntrusted components to access the root key.\nShamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) is a cryptographic method that divides a\nsecret into parts, distributing them among participants. The secret can only be\nreconstructed when a minimum number of parts (the threshold) are combined.\nThis ensures that partial knowledge of the secret does not compromise its\nsecurity.\nShamir Configuration\nConfigure the threshold and total shares using environment variables:\n\nRecommended configurations by deployment size:\nDeploymentThresholdSharesRationale\nDev/Test23Minimal redundancy\nSmall Prod35Standard config\nLarge Prod57High redundancy\nCritical710Maximum security\n\nTrade-offs to consider:\n\nHigher threshold: More secure (harder to compromise), but requires more\nKeepers to be online for recovery\nHigher shares: More redundancy (tolerate more Keeper failures), but\nrequires more Keeper instances\nLower threshold: Easier recovery (fewer shards needed), but lower security\nLower shares: Less overhead (fewer Keepers), but less fault tolerance\n\nSecurity Guarantees\nShamir Secret Sharing is information-theoretically secure. With fewer than\nthe threshold number of shards, an attacker gains zero information about\nthe root key.\nShards CompromisedSecurity Impact\n&lt; thresholdZero information leaked\n= thresholdRoot key can be reconstructed\n&gt; thresholdRoot key can be reconstructed\n\nMitigation strategies:\n\nDistribute shards across isolated Keepers in different locations\nUse mTLS with SPIFFE ID validation for all Keeper communication\nMonitor shard access through audit logs\nFollow the principle of least privilege for Keeper access\n\nShard Storage\nSPIKE Keeper storage:\n\nShards are stored in-memory only (never persisted to disk)\nShards are lost on Keeper restart but recovered from SPIKE Nexus\nProtected by process isolation and mTLS\n\nOperator storage (break-the-glass recovery):\n\nRecovery shards saved to ~/.spike/recover directory\nFile permissions are set to 0600 (owner read/write-only)\nOperator is responsible for securely storing and later erasing these files\n\nTurn Swap and Core Dumps Off\nBoth SPIKE Nexus and SPIKE Keeper maintain sensitive cryptographic\nmaterial of varying degrees of sensitivity in memory.\nAlthough SPIKE uses secure memory erasing and memory locking practices to\nas a defense mechanism against memory-based attacks, it’s a good practice to\nestablish defense-in-depth practices, especially when an exposed root key\nprovides the possibility to reveal encrypted secrets.\nIf the memory is swapped, an attacker could potentially extract this\ncryptographic key material from the swap file on the disk. This would compromise\nthe security of the system, as swap files are stored unencrypted on disk and\nmay persist even after the system is powered down.\nSimilarly, core dumps can contain a complete copy of the process memory at the\ntime of a crash, including any cryptographic keys, passwords, or other\nsensitive data that was in memory. An attacker with access to these core dump\nfiles could analyze them to extract the sensitive information.\nAlthough SPIKE considers the machine as the trust boundary and assumes the\nsystem is breached if the machine is breached, it does not mean we should relax\nsecurity if the machine is compromised. Defense in depth is still important, and\nminimizing the exposure of sensitive cryptographic material provides additional\nlayers of protection against sophisticated attacks.\nTo mitigate these risks:\n\nDisable swap entirely on systems handling sensitive cryptographic operations\nIf swap cannot be disabled, configure an encrypted swap\nDisable core dumps for security-critical applications\nEnsure proper permissions on any diagnostic files that might be generated\nConsider using memory allocation techniques that minimize exposure of\nsensitive data\n\nThese precautions help prevent attacks where adversaries might attempt to\nretrieve cryptographic keys or other sensitive information from persistent\nstorage after it has been paged out from memory or dumped during a crash.\nHardening SPIKE Keeper for Production\nSPIKE Keepers play a critical role in managing sensitive cryptographic\nmaterial, specifically handling shards that are used to generate the\nroot key that SPIKE Nexus uses to encrypt its backing store.\nAs described in the SPIKE Security Model, protecting your system\nagainst memory analysis is important, not only for SPIKE, but for any\napplication you may be running in your system.\nSystem administrators should implement the following security measures to\nprevent memory analysis:\n\nSet /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope to 2 or 3:\n\nValue 2 restricts ptrace to root-only access\nValue 3 disables ptrace completely, offering maximum security\n\n\nMake this setting permanent by adding kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 2 to\n/etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf\nConsider using SELinux or AppArmor profiles to further restrict\nprocess debugging capabilities\nIf running in a container, ensure the container runtime is configured to\ndisable ptrace capabilities (e.g.,\nusing --security-opt=no-new-privileges in Docker)\nRegular audit of processes with CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability, as this can\nbypass ptrace restrictions\n\nBy default, SPIKE Keepers are protected by multiple layers of security:\n\nmTLS API Protection: All SPIKE Keeper APIs are protected by mutual\nTLS (mTLS), preventing direct access to the shards through the API interface.\nSPIFFE Attestation: SPIKE Keepers implement SPIFFE attestation\nwhich verifies the authenticity of SPIKE Keeper binaries by validating\nattributes like the SHA hash, unix user id, and path. This prevents attackers\nfrom running malicious keeper processes, as they would fail the attestation\ncheck.\n\nAlthough these protections are in place, they need to be properly configured to\ntake effect. For example, a misconfigured SPIRE Server registration entry or\nusing a user with elevated privileges to run the SPIKE Keeper binaries may\nresult in a security breach (see the “hardening SPIRE for production” section\nbefore for details)\nHardening SPIKE Nexus for Production\nSPIKE Nexus serves as the central secrets store, maintaining sensitive data\nin memory and using encrypted storage for persistence. Due to its critical role\nin managing secrets, special attention must be paid to its security\nconfiguration.\nMemory Protection\n\nThe ptrace and yama recommendations for SPIKE Keepers covered in\nthe previous section also applies to SPIKE Nexus. Protect SPIKE\nNexus’s memory against external analysis.\nConfigure memory restrictions to prevent swapping:\n\nSet vm.swappiness=0 in sysctl configuration\nUse mlock to lock memory pages and prevent them from being swapped\nIf using systemd, set LimitMEMLOCK=infinity in the service file\n\n\nEnable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR):\n\nEnsure /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space is set to 2\n\n\nImplement memory scrubbing:\n\nConfigure automatic memory wiping for deallocated memory\nUse secure memory allocation practices for sensitive data\n\n\n\n\nMemory Security of SPIKE Keepers\nNote that these memory protection measures are also applicable for\nSPIKE Keepers where we secure shards of the root key. While a single\nshard does not expose as much risk as an exposed root key, it’s still\ngood defense in depth to secure the memory of SPIKE Keeper instances.\n\nBacking Store Security\n\nConfigure secure backup procedures:\n\nEncrypt all backups\nImplement strict access controls on backup storage\nRegular backup integrity verification\n\n\nMonitor backing store access:\n\nLog all access attempts\nImplement alerting for unusual access patterns\nRegular audit of access logs\n\n\n\nResource Management\n\nSet appropriate resource limits:\n\nConfigure memory limits based on an expected load\nSet CPU quotas to prevent resource exhaustion\nImplement disk I/O limits\n\n\nMonitor resource usage:\n\nTrack memory utilization\nMonitor CPU usage\nAlert on resource threshold violations\n\n\n\nAccess Control\n\nImplement the least privilege access:\n\nCreate dedicated service accounts\nRestrict file system permissions\nUse SELinux or AppArmor profiles\n\n\n\nDisaster Recovery\n\nDocument recovery procedures:\n\nClear steps for various failure scenarios\nRegular testing of recovery procedures\nMaintain updated recovery documentation\n\n\nConfigure backup systems:\n\nRegular backup testing\nSecure offsite storage\nAutomated recovery validation\n\n\n\nContainer-Specific Hardening\nWhen deploying SPIKE Nexus in containers:\n\nUse minimal base images:\n\nBuild from scratch or distroless images\n\nRegular security updates\n\n\n\n\nConfigure container security:\n\nEnable seccomp profiles\nSet appropriate ulimits\nImplement container isolation\n\n\n\nRemember to regularly review and update these security measures based on new\nthreats and security best practices. Security configuration should be treated\nas a continuous process rather than a one-time setup.\nConclusion\nAlthough SPIKE is designed with security best practices in mind, a\nmulti-layer approach focusing on system, process, and network security is\nimportant when configuring SPIKE for production.\nThe combination of mTLS API protection, SPIFFE attestation, and proper\nsystem-level security controls will provide robust protection against\nunauthorized access to sensitive cryptographic material.\nRemember that security is an ongoing process, and every system’s security\nposture and requirements are different. Thus, these measures outlined in this\nguide shall be taken as starting recommendations and adjusted to meet your\norganization’s security requirements.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSPIKE Cross-Platform Build\nSPIKE Production Setup\nSPIKE Recovery Procedures\nSPIKE Release Management\n\n\n\nAbout\nCommunity\nGetting Started\nUsing SPIKE\nDeveloping SPIKE\nSPIKE Architecture\nTracking\nOperations\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/operations/production/","title":"SPIKE Production Setup"},"https://spike.ist/operations/recovery/":{"body":"SPIKE Recovery Procedures\nSPIKE ensures that your secrets are secure and resilient, aiming for seamless\noperations even in the most challenging situations.

The following sections\ndescribe this “break-the-glass” procedure to help restore SPIKE back to\nits operational state:\n1. Before complete system failure:\n\nChange the SPIFFE ID of SPIKE Pilot to recovery mode by\nexecuting ./hack/bare-metal/entry/spire-server-entry-recover-register.sh\nRun spike recover\nSave the files generated in ~/.spike/recover folder to a safe,\nencrypted, and password-protected medium.\nSecurely erase the ~/.spike/recover` folder.\nChange the SPIFFE ID of SPIKE Pilot back using\n./hack/bare-metal/entry/spire-server-entry-su-register.sh or delete the registration\nentry entirely for extra security.\nYou can create the entry back using\n./hack/bare-metal/entry/spire-server-entry-su-register.sh when you need to use\nSPIKE Pilot.\n\n2. During complete system failure:\n\nChange the SPIFFE ID of SPIKE Pilot to restore mode:\n./hack/bare-metal/entry/spire-server-entry-restore-register.sh\nExecute spike restore and enter the shards you created in the\nprevious step one by one.

See ADR-0031.\n\nChanged\n\nBREAKING: SDK now returns typed sentinel errors instead of generic error\nvalues.\nBREAKING: SDK: Enhanced error handling—Get methods now return\nErrAPINotFound instead of (nil, nil) when resources are not found,\nfollowing idiomatic Go patterns (similar to os.Open, database/sql).\nSDK: Improved API consistency by standardizing policy function\nparameters from name to id across all operations, matching internal\nimplementation.\nNexus: Enhanced backend interface documentation with proper parameter and\nreturn type information, and documented CurrentVersion == 0 behavior in\nLoadSecret and LoadAllSecrets methods.\nNexus: Comprehensive documentation updates for all secret management functions\nwith accurate parameter names, return types, and behavioral details including\nsoft-delete semantics and metadata update logic.\nNexus: Made DeleteSecret more defensive when finding the new current version\nby removing unnecessary condition, improving code clarity and robustness.\nBREAKING: Nexus: Fixed inconsistent error returns in memory backend -\nLoadSecret now returns ErrEntityNotFound instead of (nil, nil) for\nmissing secrets.\nNexus: Optimized retry loop in InitializeBackingStoreFromKeepers with early\nnil check to avoid unnecessary function call overhead when X509 source is nil.\nNexus: Refactored ShardGetResponse to return ([]byte, *sdkErrors.SDKError)\ninstead of logging errors internally and returning empty slices, following\ncanonical Go error handling patterns.\nNexus: Improved resilience in data loading functions (LoadAllPolicies,\nLoadAllSecrets) by changing from aggressive exit behavior to graceful\ndegradation - now logs warnings and continues processing valid entries instead\nof abandoning entire dataset on single entry corruption.\nPilot: Comprehensive refactoring of CLI output handling across all commands\n(14 files) to use Cobra’s cmd.Print*() methods instead of fmt.Print*().\nError messages now properly route to stderr via cmd.PrintErrln()/\ncmd.PrintErrf(), while success and normal output routes to stdout via\ncmd.Println()/cmd.Printf(). This improves testability, respects Cobra’s\noutput configuration, and provides proper stderr/stdout separation. Updated\nhelper functions printSecretResponse() and handleAPIError() to accept\ncmd parameter for consistent output handling.\nSDK: Added UpdatedAt field to Policy struct to track when policies are\nmodified. Removed unused CreatedBy field.\nNexus: Standardized error handling across recovery modules to use\nlog.WarnErr/log.FatalErr with SDK error types instead of generic\nlog.Warn/log.FatalLn calls. This provides searchable error codes and\nconsistent error patterns.\nBREAKING: Nexus: Changed policy operations from create-only to upsert\nsemantics for consistency with secret operations. state.CreatePolicy is now\nstate.UpsertPolicy. If a policy with the same name exists, it is updated\n(preserving ID and CreatedAt); otherwise, a new policy is created.\nCode Quality: Eliminated error variable shadowing across the codebase. Error\nvariables now use descriptive names (atoiErr, nonceErr, openErr,\nrestoreErr, etc.) instead of reusing err. This prevents subtle bugs where\na later error could inadvertently shadow an earlier one and improves code\nreadability by making error sources explicit.\n\nFixed\n\nFinally, fixed the flaky tests around the retry logic in SPIKE Go SDK for\ngood.\nVarious other bugfixes, refactorings, and security improvements.\nSDK: Added nil validation to CreateMTLSServer functions with fail-fast\nbehavior for configuration errors.\nSDK: Fixed resource management bug in StreamPostWithContentType where defer\nwas closing response body on the success path, causing callers to receive closed\nbody.\nSDK: Fixed critical bug in Undelete function that was ignoring the versions\nparameter due to missing else clause.\nNexus: Added OldestVersion tracking to UndeleteSecret for consistency\nwith DeleteSecret, ensuring metadata accurately reflects the oldest\nnon-deleted version.\nNexus: Fixed bug in UndeleteSecret where undeleting a version higher than\nthe current CurrentVersion did not update CurrentVersion to reflect the\nnew highest active version, causing metadata inconsistency.\nNexus: Fixed critical bug in UpsertSecret where adding a new version when all\nexisting versions were deleted (CurrentVersion == 0) would create version 1,\npotentially colliding with an existing deleted version 1. Now correctly finds\nthe highest existing version number and increments from there.\nNexus: Fixed resource leak in internal/net/post.go where response body\nclose was deferred after body read instead of immediately after response\nobtained, causing leaks when read operations failed.\nNexus: Fixed a critical bug in secret route handlers where error paths were not\nsending HTTP responses to clients. Added missing net.Fail() calls in\nput_intercept.go (3 locations) and undelete.go to ensure proper error\nresponses.\nNexus: Fixed bug in RouteDeletePolicy that returned HTTP 500 for all errors\nincluding “not found.” Now correctly returns HTTP 404 when the policy does not\nexist\n\nSecurity\n\nPoP validation after the bootstrap sequence to ensure SPIKE Nexus has\ninitialized properly.\nUpdate SPIKE Components’ Go version to 1.25.3.\nlog.FatalLn exits cleanly by default to avoid leaking sensitive information\nvia stack traces in production. Stack traces can be enabled for\ndevelopment/testing by setting SPIKE_STACK_TRACES_ON_LOG_FATAL=true.\nSDK upgrade to Go 1.25.3 to fix GO-2025-4007.\nFixed error handling inconsistency in NewPilotRecoveryShards to\nensure fail-fast behavior on shard generation failures. The function now\nconsistently uses log.FatalLn for all critical errors during shard\nmarshaling to prevent silent generation of corrupted recovery material.\nAdded SPIFFE ID validation to SPIKE Keeper shard endpoints.\nThe RouteShard endpoint now validates that only SPIKE Nexus can retrieve\nshards during recovery operations. The RouteContribute endpoint validates\nthat only SPIKE Bootstrap (during initial setup) or SPIKE Nexus (during\nperiodic updates) can contribute shards. This prevents unauthorized access\nto sensitive shard data.\nCrypto: Consolidated GCM nonce size constant (crypto.GCMNonceSize) to\ninternal/crypto/gcm.go. This removes duplication across cipher and bootstrap\npackages and documents the decision to use the NIST-recommended 12-byte\nstandard. See ADR-0032.\nFixed CWE-117: go-viper’s mapstructure May Leak Sensitive Information in\nLogs When Processing Malformed\nData\nFixed CVE-2025-58181: golang.org/x/crypto/ssh allows an attacker to cause\nunbounded memory\nconsumption\nFixed CVE-2025-47914: golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/agent vulnerable to panic if\nmessage is malformed due to out of bounds\nread\n\n[0.6.1] - 2025-10-02\nThis is a patch release to align with the changes in the upstream helm charts.\n[0.6.0] - 2025-10-01\nThis was a security release where the main focus was hardening SPIKE SDK mTLS\nimplementation. In addition, we created a configurable SPIKE backing store\ndirectory to enable future HA development.\nAdded\n\nAdded SPIKE_TRUST_ROOT_BOOTSTRAP to enable SPIKE Bootstrap to be used\nin different trust boundaries.\nAdded SPIKE_NEXUS_DATA_DIR to enable setting up custom data directories for\nSPIKE Nexus backing store.\nAdded convenience methods to the SPIKE Go SDK.\n\nChanged\n\nImprovements to the SPIKE Go SDK.\nStricter SPIFFE ID validation. SPIKE SDK now ensures that the API client\nonly talks to SPIKE Nexus as the server.\n\nFixed\n\nMinor bug fixes.\nFixed flaky unit tests.\n\nSecurity\n\nSPIKE Go SDK clients are hardened to only talk to SPIKE Nexus as the\nserver during mTLS.\n\n[0.5.1] - 2025-09-14\nChanged\n\nUpdated SPIKE Bootstrap to be more robust by adding exponential backoff while\nwaiting for SPIKE Keepers to be ready.\nEnhancements in startup scripts to better enable local development with\nSPIFFE Helm Charts that have not been published yet.\n\n[0.5.0] - 2025-09-11\nThis is still a prerelease version; however, it includes major changes\nand improvements. We will cut a stable release once we have SPIKE Bootstrap\nincluded in the SPIFFE Helm Charts.\nAdded\n\nUpdates to documentation and usage examples.\nUpdates to the SPIKE Go SDK around the logging API.\nMoved certain reusable features from in-tree to SPIKE Go SDK.\nA new make audit target that helps contributors run style checks and\nlinters before submitting a PR.\nEnhancements to bare-metal installation scripts.\n\nChanged\n\nUpdated Go version to 1.25.1\nUpdated SPIKE Bootstrap to be more robust and enabled it to work on\nKubernetes too.\nClarified documentation around path pattern and SPIFFE ID pattern matching\nin SPIKE policies.\nSlight improvements in the SPIKE logo and a brand-new landing page that\nhighlights the project’s vision and goals.\nMoved environment variable names to the SPIKE Go SDK as constants to prevent\ntypos and to make it easier to use the SDK.\n\nFixed\n\nBug fixes and stability improvements.\nFixed failing unit tests on CI (that’s a temporary fix that runs tests\nsequentially instead of in parallel; we will fix that soon)\n\nSecurity\n\nAlong with secrets, SPIKE Nexus now encrypts policies at rest too.\n\nUpcoming\n\nA lot of ongoing design work around key rotation, encryption, and a secure\nweb interface that leverages Web Cryptography API to provide a secure\nexperience of managing secrets without having to interact with the command\nline.\nOngoing work on the Cipher API to provide “encryption as a service” to\nsystems and workloads that do not require to store secrets in a backing store.\n\n[0.4.3] - 2025-08-16 (prerelease)\nThis is a “prerelease” version to enable upstream SPIFFE Helm Charts\nintegration initiatives. The most significant change is the introduction of a\nSPIKE Bootstrap app that is responsible for initializing\nSPIKE Nexus. This new approach separates the bootstrapping workflow that\nhad been inside SPIKE Nexus’ initialization workflow before. And that\nenables us an opportunity to run SPIKE Nexus in HA mode without designing\nelaborate, and potentially error-prone, consensus algorithms.\nAdded\n\nFIPS 140.3 Compliance: FIPS is now enabled at build time, and it’s\nenforced everywhere. We are using GOFIPS140=v1.0.0, the modern way of\nenabling FIPS, retiring our older boringcrypto implementation.\nspike policy list command can now filter by SPIFFE ID pattern and path\npattern.\nspike policy command cano now accept a YAML file as input, instead of\nrequiring command-line parameters.\nSPIKE Go SDK now has a generator that creates pattern-based, secure,\nrandomized secrets.\nImplemented a (currently experimental) “SPIKE Lite” mode where SPIKE Nexus\nwould not need a backing store, or policies, and can leverage the storage\nand policy mechanism of S3-compatible object stores (such as Minio). Once\nwe fully implement and polish SPIKE Lite, we will also update documentation\nand use cases to allow users to understand the benefits and liabilities of\nSPIKE Lite and why they might want to use one over the other.\n\nChanged\n\nBetter alignment with idiomatic Go practices. SPIKE and SPIKE Go SDK code\nhas been refactored to better align with common Go idioms and conventions.\nWe also created a make audit target to run style checks and linters that\nenforce a consistent code style and some of these guidelines. make audit\nis also a part of the CI pipeline to ensure that the code is always compliant\nat every commit. In addition make audit also does vulnerability checks.\nBREAKING: SPIKE Nexus now requires a separate initializer (SPIKE Bootstrap)\nto begin its lifecycle. The user guides and relevant documentation have been\nupdated to reflect this change.\nUpdated Go to the latest version (1.24.6).\n\nFixed\n\nFixed a bug related to Windows builds. SPIKE Nexus, SPIKE Pilot, and SPIKE\nKeeper can now be built as Windows binaries too.\nVarious refactorings, improvements, code cleanup, and bug fixes.\n\n[0.4.2] - 2025-07-19\nAdded\n\nAbility to configure to not how SPIKE banner on startup.\nAbility to configure to show a warning if memory locking is not\navailable on the system.\nSPIKE can now be deployed from SPIFFE helm charts. Tested and verified!\nDocumentation updates.\nSPIKE can now be installed from SPIFFE Helm\nCharts and can\nfederate secrets across clusters\n\nChanged\n\nMoved logging to SPIKE SDK. VSecM v2 will share the same logging setup.\nspike policy command now accepts file input; you can design your policies\nas yaml files and then spike policy apply -f them.\n\nSecurity\n\nFixed GHSA-fv92-fjc5-jj9h: mapstructure May Leak Sensitive Information\nin Logs When Processing Malformed\nData\n\n[0.4.1] - 2025-06-01 (prerelease)\nAdded\n\nInitial support for Kubernetes deployments.\nBetter shard sanitization during recovery procedures.\nAdded memory locking to SPIKE Pilot too.\nFiner control of the startup script via flags.\nAdded the ability to optionally skip database schema creation during SPIKE\ninitialization.\n\nChanged\n\nBREAKING: SDK validation methods now take trust root as an argument.\nBREAKING: SPIKE_NEXUS_KEEPER_URL is now a comma-delimited list of URLs\n(instead of JSON).\nSPIKE components can now be configured to accept multiple trust roots as\nlegitimate peers—this will be useful in complex mesh and federation\ndeployment scenarios.\nSPIKE now uses GitHub Container Registry to store its container image\n(instead of Docker Hub).\n\nFixed\n\nFixed a bug where the doomsday recovery procedure was not immediately\nrestoring the data.\n\n[0.4.0] - 2025-04-16\nAdded\n\nAdded more configuration options to SPIKE Nexus.\nUpdated documentation around security and production hardening.\nUpdated release instructions, added a series of tests to follow and cutting\na release only after all tests pass. These tests are manual for now but\ncan be automated later down the line.\n\nFixed\n\nFixed a bug related to policies not recovering after a SPIKE Nexus crash.\nNow, both secrets and policies recover without an issue.\nEnsured that “in memory” mode works as expected, and we can create policies\nand secrets.\nFixed inconsistencies in the audit log format.\nFixed NilPointer exception during certain shard creation paths.\nFixed regressions due to premature memory cleanup. Now the memory is cleaned\nup when no longer needed (but not before).\nVarious bug fixes and improvements.\n\nChanged\n\nMoved some common reusable code to spike-sdk-go.\nVarious changes and improvements in SPIKE Go SDK.\nThe startup script does not initiate SPIKE Keepers if SPIKE is running in\n“in memory” mode.\nRenamed AuditCreated enum as AuditEntryCreated to specify its intention\nbetter (i.e., it’s not creation of an entity or a DAO, but rather it’s\nthe start of an audit trail).\nImproved spike policy commands with better UX and error handling.\n\nSecurity\n\nAdded cache invalidation headers to all API responses.\nFor added security, we strip symbols during the build process now.\nImplemented better memory protection with cleaning up memory when no longer needed.\nSPIKE Nexus and SPIKE Keepers use mlock to avoid memory swapping when possible.\nFixed CVE-2025-22872: golang.org/x/net vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting\nFixed CVE-2025-22870: HTTP Proxy bypass using IPv6 Zone IDs in golang.org/x/net\n\n[0.3.1] - 2025-03-04\nAdded\n\nSPIKE Nexus now accepts a dynamic number of SPIKE Keepers and Shamir share\nthreshold (defaults to 3 keepers, and minimum 2 shares (out of 3) to\nrecreate the root key).\nStarted containerization work (created a Dockerfile); yet it’s far from\ncomplete: We will work on that.\nVarious documentation updates.\nMinor bug fixes in initialization scripts.\n\nChanged\n\nSecrets now rehydrate from the backing store immediately after SPIKE\nNexus crashes. Former implementation was using an optimistic algorithm\n(i.e., do not load the secret unless you need it), yet that was causing\ncalls to spike secret list return an empty collection. This implementation\nfixes that issue and also ensures that SPIKE Nexus’ memory continues to\nbe the primary source of truth (by design).\n\nSecurity\n\nSPIKE Nexus now securely erases the old root key and shards from memory after\nit is no longer necessary. Before, it was left to the garbage collector to\nhandle that. The current approach is NIST recommendation and provides better\nmemory protection.\nFixed CVE-2025-271447: DoS in go-jose Parsing\n\n[0.3.0] - 2025-02-20\nThis release was focused around bugfixes, stability, documentation, and\ndisaster recovery.\nAdded\n\nDocumentation: SPIKE Production Hardening Guide is complete and ready for\nconsumption (it was in draft mode before).\nImplemented spike operator recover and spike operator restore commands\nthat provide disaster recovery capabilities if there is a total system crash\nand the remaining SPIKE Keepers are less than the threshold to recover the\nroot key.\nSeveral bugfixes and performance improvements.\nAdded a coverage report to the repository. The coverage is not as high as\nwe would like to be; yet we have to start somewhere :).\nAdded several architectural decision records to share the projects’ vision\nand design decisions transparently.\nStarted working on containerization (though it’s still a work in progress).\n\nChanged\n\nSPIKE Website has undergone a major overhaul.\nDocumentation updates, especially around security and disaster recovery.\nDocumentation is now consistent with the code: Removed outdated sections,\nintroduced new modules, explained current workflows and state transitions.\nMoved documentation from Docsify to Zola, that gave, speed, flexibility,\ntemplateability, and consistency to the overall documentation.\nSignificant updates in SPIKE go SDK.\n\n[0.2.1] - 2025-01-23\nAdded\n\nEnabled policy-based access control.\nThe root key that SPIKE Nexus generates is now split into several Shamir\nshards and distributed to SPIKE Keepers.\nNew additions and improvements to SPIKE Go SDK.\nVarious minor bugfixes.\nCode cleanup.\nImplemented several recovery scenarios.\nSPIKE now has static analysis, CI integration, linting, and automated tests.\nDocumentation updates. Documentation is still lagging behind, but we are\nupdating and improving it along the way.\nCreated a makefile to group related scripts into make targets.\nMade the start script more robust.\nEnsured that the policies and the demo app work as expected.\nImplemented a Secret Metadata API.\nImplemented exponential retries across several API-consuming methods.\n\nChanged\n\nBREAKING: changed the CLI usage. Instead of spike get, for example, we\nnow use spike secret get. The reason for this change is that we introduced\na policy command (i.e. spike policy get).\n\nSecurity\n\nFixed CVE-2024-45337: Misuse of ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback may cause\nauthorization bypass in golang.org/x/crypto\nFixed CVE-2024-45338: Non-linear parsing of case-insensitive content in\ngolang.org/x/net/htm\n\n[0.2.0] - 2024-11-22\nAdded\n\nAdded configuration options for SPIKE Nexus and SPIKE Keeper.\nDocumentation updates.\nMax secret version is now configurable.\nIntroduced standard and configurable logging.\nAdded sqlite3 as a backing store.\nEnabled cross-compilation and SHA checksums.\nEnhanced audit trails and error logging.\nCreated initial smoke/integration tests.\nStability improvements.\n\nChanged\n\nRemoved password authentication for admin users.

It allows\nprivileged operators with specific SPIFFE roles to perform critical operations\nfor maintaining SPIKE Nexus’ resilience.\nQuick Start\n\nWhat is SPIKE Operator Mode?\nThe Operator mode in SPIKE provides privileged functionality for system\nmaintenance and recovery. These commands:\n\nAre restricted to users with specific SPIFFE roles (recover or restore)\nHandle sensitive security operations for disaster recovery\nManage the cryptographic shards needed for system restoration\nProvide secure mechanisms for recovering from catastrophic system failures\n\nOperator commands are the safety net for SPIKE installations, ensuring that\neven in worst-case scenarios, the system can be recovered without compromising\nsecurity.\nCommands\nspike operator recover\n\nThe recover command allows privileged operators with the recover role to\nextract recovery shards from a healthy SPIKE Nexus system.

It allows administrators to define, view, and manage rules\nthat control access to secrets and resources based on workload identity\n(SPIFFE ID) and resource paths.\nSPIKE provides two commands for managing policies:\n\nspike policy create—Traditional command-line interface\n(backward compatibility)\nspike policy apply—Enhanced command with YAML file support\n(recommended for new workflows)\n\nWhile spike policy create checks for the existence of a policy, and\nerrors out if we are overriding an existing policy, spike policy apply uses\nupsert semantics—it will create a new policy if one doesn’t exist, or\nupdate an existing policy if one with the same name already exists. This makes\nthe spike policy apply command safe to use in automation and GitOps workflows.\nQuick Start\n\nYAML File Format\nBasic Structure\n\nRealistic SPIFFE ID Pattern and Path Pattern Examples\n\nAll Available Permissions\n\nAlternative YAML Formats\nFlow Sequence for Permissions\n\nQuoted Values\n\nCreating Policies Using Command-Line Flags\nInstead of using a yaml file, you can provide command-line arguments\nto programmatically create your policies too:\n\nWhat are SPIKE Policies?\nPolicies in SPIKE provide a secure and flexible way to control access to\nsecrets and resources. Each policy defines:\n\nWho can access resources (via SPIFFE ID patterns)\nWhat resources can be accessed (via path patterns)\nHow resources can be accessed (via permissions)\n\nPolicies are the cornerstone of SPIKE’s security model, allowing for\nfine-grained access control based on workload identity. Using\nSPIFFE IDs as the foundation, SPIKE ensures that\nonly authorized workloads can access sensitive information.\nHow Policies Work\nWhen a workload attempts to access a resource in SPIKE:\n\nThe workload presents its SPIFFE ID through a\nSPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document (SVID)\nSPIKE validates the SVID to verify the workload’s identity\nSPIKE checks if any policy matches both:\n\nThe workload’s SPIFFE ID against the policy’s SPIFFE ID pattern\nThe requested resource path against the policy’s path pattern\n\n\nIf a match is found, SPIKE checks if the requested operation is allowed by\nthe policy’s permissions\nAccess is granted only if ALL conditions are met\n\nWhy Use Policies?\n\nZero Trust Security: Access is based on workload identity, not network\nlocation\nLeast Privilege: Grant only the permissions needed for each workload\nAuditability: All access is tied to specific policies and identities\nFlexibility: Patterns support regular expression matching, which allows\na more fine-grained control over which resources the policy applies to.\nScalability: Policies work consistently across any deployment size\n\nFeatures\n\nCreate policies with specific permissions and access patterns\nApply policies using upsert semantics (create new or update existing)\nList all policies in human-readable or JSON format\nGet policy details by ID or name\nDelete policies with confirmation protection\nEnhanced validation for permissions and parameters\n\nCommands\nspike policy list\n\nLists all policies in the system. Can be filtered by a resource path pattern or\na SPIFFE ID pattern.\nWhen using filters, you must provide the exact regular expression pattern as\ndefined in the policies you want to match. For example, if a policy is defined\nwith pattern ^secrets/database/production$, you must use exactly that pattern\nto find it—no partial matches or simpler patterns will work.\nNote: --path-pattern and --spiffeid-pattern flags cannot be used\ntogether.\nspike policy create\n\nCreates a new policy with the specified parameters.\nspike policy apply\n\nCreates a new policy with file-based input using YAML configuration.\nYAML Configuration Format\nWhen using the --file flag, the YAML file should follow this structure:\n\nExample Files\nSPIKE repository has the following example policies for your convenience:\n\n./examples/policies/sample-policy.yaml—Basic policy example\n./examples/policies/test-policies/basic-policy.yaml—Minimal\npolicy\n./examples/policies/test-policies/admin-policy.yaml—Full\npermissions policy\n./examples/policies/test-policies/invalid-permissions.yaml—Example\nwith invalid permissions (for testing)\n\nPermission Types\nPermissionDescription\nreadAllows reading secrets and resources\nwriteAllows creating, updating, and deleting secrets\nlistAllows listing resources and directories\nexecuteAllows cipher operations (encrypt/decrypt)\nsuperFull administrative permissions (use with caution)\n\nValidation\nAll policy configurations are validated to ensure:\n\nRequired fields: name, spiffeidPattern, pathPattern, and\npermissions must be present\nValid permissions: Only read, write, list, execute, and super\nare allowed\nValid YAML syntax: Proper YAML formatting is required (for YAML files)\nNon-empty values: All fields must have non-empty values\n\nGitOps Integration\nYAML files can be easily integrated into GitOps workflows:\n\n\nStore policy YAML files in a Git repository\n\n\n\nUse CI/CD pipelines to validate policies before deployment\n\n\n\nApply policies using spike policy apply --file in deployment scripts\n\n\n\nVersion control changes to policies alongside application code\n\n\nUse upsert semantics to safely apply policy changes without worrying\nabout conflicts\n\n\nspike policy get\n\nGets details of a specific policy by ID or name. Use --format=json\nfor machine-readable output.\nspike policy delete\n\nDeletes a policy by ID or name. Requires confirmation.\nUsage Examples\n\nPattern Syntax\nSPIKE policies support regular expression pattern matching for both\nSPIFFE IDs and resource paths:\n\nThe pattern is compiled as a “regular expression”.\n\nThis would mean, for an exact match, you would need to include ^ and $ in\nyour patterns as well.\nFor example:\n\nsecrets/db matches global/secrets/db and secrets/db/local\nWhereas, ^secrets/db$ only matches secrets/db and nothing else\n(global/secrets/db and secrets/db/local will not match)\n\nThus, for precise control, you are encouraged to include ^ and $ at the\nbeginning and end of your patterns respectively for an exact match.\nHow Regular Expressions are Used For Policy Matching\nMore specifically, SPIKE compiles SPIFFE ID patterns and\npath patterns defined in the policies into regular\nexpressions.\nHere is a simplified version of how this regular expression compilation\nhappens behind-the-scenes:\n\nAs seen from the example above, both the path pattern and the SPIFFE ID\npattern that are provided during policy creation which are used “AS IS” to\ncreate regular expression matchers. These patterns are compiled\ninto Go’s built-in regex engine, ensuring that the matching process strictly\nadheres to the patterns defined in the policy, allowing for precise and flexible\naccess control.\nSimplicity Is the Key\nBecause of the regular expression usage in SPIKE policies, a policy create\noperation can define more flexible matching patterns. However, keeping patterns\nsimple is both more secure and easier to manage and reason about. Creating a\npattern that is too broad or that uses overly complex regular expressions may\nlead to unintended consequences and security risks. Simplicity is important\nto ensure patterns are clear, predictable, and effective.\nWhen a workload attempts to access a resource, its SPIFFE ID and the\nrequested resource path are matched against these compiled regular\nexpressions. This ensures that both identity and resource patterns follow the\nspecified rules and allow for flexibility with wildcards or exact matches.\nPath Pattern Examples\n\nSPIFFE ID Pattern Examples\n\nBest Practices\n\nFollow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions\nUse descriptive policy names that reflect their purpose\nCreate separate policies for different workload types\nUse specific path patterns rather than overly broad ones\nRegularly audit and review your policies\nNever assign super permissions unless absolutely necessary\n\nTechnical Details\nPermission Hierarchy\nThe super permission acts as a wildcard that grants all other permissions:\nPermissionDescription\nsuperAll permissions (wildcard)\nwriteCreate and update secrets\nreadRead secrets\nlistList secret paths\nexecuteCipher operations (encrypt/decrypt)\n\nAuthorization for Policy Management\nPolicy management operations (create, update, delete) are authorized as follows:\n\nSPIKE Pilot (spiffe://&lt;trustRoot&gt;/spike/pilot/*) has full access to\nall operations, including policy management\nOther workloads need a policy granting write permission on the\nsystem path spike/system/acl\n\nEncryption at Rest\nPolicy details are encrypted in the database using AES-256-GCM:\nEncrypted fields:\n\nSPIFFE ID Pattern (regex string)\nPath Pattern (regex string)\nPermissions (JSON array)\n\nNot encrypted:\n\nPolicy name (used for lookups)\nPolicy ID\nTimestamps\n\nA single nonce is generated per policy and used for all encrypted fields\nto ensure atomicity.\nPolicy Evaluation\nWhen a secret is accessed, SPIKE Nexus evaluates policies by:\n\nChecking if the requestor is SPIKE Pilot (grants immediate access)\nLoading all policies from the backing store\nFor each policy, checking if the SPIFFE ID pattern matches the requestor\nIf matched, checking if the path pattern matches the requested resource\nIf matched, checking if the policy grants the required permission\nAccess is granted on first match; there are no “deny” policies\n\nPolicies are loaded fresh from the database on each request to ensure\nchanges take effect immediately.\nRegex Safety\nSPIKE uses Go’s regexp package which provides linear-time matching\nguarantees.

It allows administrators to create, read, update, and delete secrets\nbased on SPIFFE identities and corresponding access policies.\nQuick Start\n\nWhat are SPIKE Secrets?\nSecrets in SPIKE are sensitive pieces of information that need to be\nsecurely stored, accessed, and managed. Each secret:\n\nIs stored at a specific path\nContains one or more key-value pairs\nHas version history for auditing and recovery\nIs protected by access policies based on workload identity\n\nSecrets are the core data objects managed by SPIKE, providing a secure way\nto distribute sensitive configuration data, credentials, and other confidential\ninformation to authorized workloads based on their SPIFFE identities.\nHow Secrets Work\nWhen a workload attempts to access a secret in SPIKE:\n\nThe workload presents its SPIFFE ID through a SPIFFE Verifiable Identity\nDocument (SVID)\nSPIKE validates the SVID to verify the workload’s identity\nSPIKE checks if any policy allows the workload to access the requested\nsecret path\nIf authorized, the secret is securely delivered to the workload\n\nThis ensures that only authorized workloads can access specific secrets based on\ntheir verified identity, following zero-trust security principles.\nPath Syntax and Conventions\nSecret paths in SPIKE have specific syntax requirements and recommended\nconventions to ensure consistency and avoid common pitfalls.\nPaths in SPIKE are designed to provide flexibility but also follow\ncertain conventions for clarity and usability. While the path is\nsuggested (but not mandated) to look like a UNIX-style path for familiarity,\nSPIKE secret paths SHOULD NOT start with a leading slash.\nThis is because SPIKE paths represent logical key namespaces, not\nhierarchical filesystem paths. They are always relative to the secrets engine\nmount point, making the leading slash redundant and potentially confusing.\nAdditionally, although there is currently no restriction on how the path is\nformed, it is worth noting that future versions of SPIKE may restrict paths\nfrom having a trailing slash to avoid ambiguity and maintain consistency\nin naming practices.\nExample:\n\nCorrect: secrets/app/config\nRedundant/Confusing: /secrets/app/config\n\nPath Format Requirements\nAll secret paths must match the regex pattern:\n\nThis pattern allows alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, hyphens, forward\nslashes, parentheses, question marks, plus signs, asterisks, pipes, square\nbrackets, curly braces, and backslashes.\nPath Format Recommendations\nWhile the validation requirements allow for flexibility, the following\nconventions are strongly recommended:\n\nAvoid leading slashes: Paths should not start with a forward slash (/)\nUse forward slashes to create hierarchical structures (like a file system)\nUse descriptive, hierarchical naming to organize secrets logically\nAvoid double slashes or other ambiguous path constructions\nAvoid special characters when possible, even if they are technically allowed\n\nExample Valid Paths\n\n✅ secrets/myapp/config - Clear hierarchy, no leading slash\n✅ secrets/db-creds/admin-user - Well-structured with hyphens\n✅ tenantA/projectX/env1/key - Multi-level organization\n\nExample Invalid or Discouraged Paths\n\n❌ /secrets/myapp/config - Avoid leading slashes\n❌ secrets//double-slash - Avoid double slashes\n❌ secret\\path - Avoid backslashes (use forward slashes)\n❌ secret path/with space - Avoid spaces\n❌ secret#invalid?path - Avoid URL-reserved characters when possible\n\nBest Path Practices\n\nUse consistent prefixes like secrets/ or credentials/ as the first segment\nOrganize paths by application, service, or environment\nInclude version indicators in the path for managed rotation\n(e.g., secrets/database/v1/credentials)\nUse clear, descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the secret\nKeep paths reasonably short while maintaining clarity\n\nPath Examples\n\nBest Practices\n\nOrganize secrets hierarchically with descriptive paths\nUse separate paths for different environments (dev, staging, production)\nLimit the number of key-value pairs in a single secret for better management\nUse version history for auditing and rollback capability\nCreate specific policies that grant the minimum required access to each\nsecret path\nRegularly rotate sensitive secrets like API keys and passwords\nUse secret delete and undelete for safe secret lifecycle management\nValidate paths are properly formatted and follow naming conventions\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\nEach secret access is authenticated and authorized based on workload identity\nVersion history allows for audit trails and secure secret rotation\nDeleted secrets can be recovered if needed\nSecret access is controlled by the spike policy permissions system\n\nFeatures\n\nStore secrets as key-value pairs at specific paths\nRetrieve secrets with full or partial key selection\nList available secrets across the system\nDelete and undelete secret versions for lifecycle management\nView secret metadata to track changes and versioning\nPath validation to ensure proper secret organization\n\nCommands\nspike secret list\n\nLists all available secret paths in the system.
