We need to determine the most secure and practical way\nto display these secrets while maintaining system security and operational\nefficiency.\nDecision Drivers\n\nSecurity of sensitive information\nOperational efficiency for administrators\nPrevention of workarounds that could increase attack surface\nAuditability of secret access\nUser experience for administrators\n\nConsidered Options\n\nDisplay secrets in plain text\nDisplay only encrypted secrets\nNever display secrets through admin interface\n\nDecision\nDisplay secrets in plain text in the SPIKE Pilot admin CLI, while providing\nadditional interfaces to view only keys or metadata when full secret values\naren’t needed.\nRationale\n\nAdministrators who can write and delete secrets should logically be able to\nview them.\nEncrypting displayed secrets provides false security since:\n\nAdmins with access likely have decryption keys anyway\nIt only adds inconvenience without meaningful security benefits\n\n\nPreventing secret viewing would likely lead to:\n\nCreation of throwaway secret consumer apps\nIncreased attack surface through workarounds\n\n\nExisting security measures provide adequate protection:\n\nmTLS for secret fetching\nShort-lived sessions\nAudit logging through SPIKE Nexus\nAuthentication and authorization checks\n\n\n\nConsequences\nPositive\n\nSimplified admin operations\nReduced likelihood of workarounds\nClear audit trail of secret access\nConsistent with principle of least surprise\n\nNegative\n\nPotential for secrets to appear in logs or command history\nIncreased responsibility on admin access control\n\nImplementation Notes\n\nImplement separate interfaces for:\n\nFull secret display\nKeys-only view\nMetadata-only view\n\n\nEnsure proper

Session Token Storage Strategy for SPIKE Nexus\n\n\nStatus: accepted\nDate: 2024-11-03\nTags: Security, Sessions, Memory Management, Scalability\n\nContext\nSPIKE Nexus requires storage of session tokens for admin authentication.\nWe need to evaluate the option of storing these tokens in-memory (as opposed\nto storing them in a database).\nKey considerations:\n\nSPIKE Nexus is primarily used by administrators, not end-users\nSession persistence across server restarts is not a critical requirement\nSecurity is a primary concern for the SPIKE ecosystem\nUser scale is limited (admin-focused tool)\nMemory consumption for session tokens is minimal\n\nDecision\nWe will implement in-memory storage for session tokens in SPIKE Nexus\ninstead of storing them in the database.\nRationale\nWhy In-Memory Storage:\nEnhanced Security\n\nEliminates risks associated with persistent storage\nReduces attack surface by removing database attack vectors\nAutomatic token invalidation on server restart provides security benefit\nAligns with SPIKE’s security-first approach\n\nPerformance\n\nFaster token validation due to in-memory access\nEliminates encryption/decryption overhead\nReduces database load\n\nSimplicity\n\nSimpler implementation and maintenance\nNo need for token cleanup mechanisms\nReduces complexity in encryption management\n\nScale Considerations\n\nLimited admin users means memory impact is negligible\nSession tokens are small in size\nVertical scaling is sufficient for admin-focused tool\n\nWhy Not Database Storage\n\nSession persistence across restarts is not a requirement\nAdditional security exposure through database is unnecessary\nEncryption/decryption overhead is not justified\nDatabase cleanup complexity can be avoided\n\nConsequences\nPositive:\n\nImproved security posture\nSimplified implementation\nBetter performance\nReduced maintenance overhead\n\nNegative:\n\nSessions will be lost on server restart/crash\nNo persistent audit trail of sessions\nPotential minor increase in memory usage\nMay complicate future horizontal scaling if needed\n\nMitigations:\n\nClear documentation that sessions require re-authentication after server restart\nImplement proper logging for security events to compensate for lack of session history\nMonitor memory usage in production\nConsider distributed caching

essentially encrypted blobs\nAccess is path-based\nAuthorization decisions are made at the path level\nStorage and retrieval operations are simple CRUD operations\n\nDecision\nWe will use S3-compatible storage systems (AWS S3, MinIO) as the backing\nstore for SPIKE, leveraging their native policy engines for access control.\nRationale\nAuthorization Model\n\nS3’s IAM/policy engine is battle-tested and well-understood\nPath-based policies align perfectly with SPIKE’s access patterns\nEliminates need to build and maintain a custom policy framework\nPolicies can be managed through

purposes:\n\nAuthorization source (via IAM/policies)\nPersistent backup store\n\n\nWrite pattern:\n\nCheck S3 policy authorization\nIf authorized, write to memory\nAsynchronously write to S3 for persistence\n\n\nRead pattern:\n\nCheck S3 policy authorization\nIf authorized, serve from memory\nOnly read from S3 during cold starts or recovery\n\nfor non-HA deployments\nfor HA deployments, the design will need to be adjusted\n\n\n\n\nDelete pattern:\n\nCheck S3 policy authorization\nIf authorized, remove from memory\nMark as deleted in S3 (using versioning)\n\n\n\nStorage Layer\n\nUse AWS SDK for S3 operations\nImplement storage interface that can work with any S3-compatible system\nEncrypt all data before storage\nUse versioning for secret history\n\nCaching Strategy\n\nImplement in-memory cache for performance\nCache only after confirming S3 permissions\nClear cache on policy changes\nImplement TTL for cached items\n\nPolicy Management\n\nUse native S3 policy format\nDocument common policy patterns\nProvide helper utilities for policy creation\nTest policies across different S3 implementations\n\nFuture Considerations\n\nIf more complex policy requirements emerge, we can:\n\nContinue using S3 for storage\nIntegrate OPA or similar for advanced policy evaluation\nKeep existing S3 policies as coarse-grained control\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAWS S3 Policy Documentation\nMinIO Security Guide\nOPA (Open Policy Agent) Documentation\n\nNotes\nThis approach keeps SPIKE lean and focused while leveraging battle-tested\ncomponents for storage and

The secrets\nare encrypted and backed up to a secondary backup storage; however, the primary\nsource of truth is the in-memory store.\nThis is an efficient mechanism to store application secrets (e.g.,\nAPI keys, certificates, even relatively beefy Kubeconfig files).\nHowever, we need to maintain certain requirements for SPIKE to be a\nproduction-grade secure, reliable, and robust secrets store:\nOur requirements include:\n\nHigh-Performance Access: Secrets should be rapidly retrievable with\nminimal latency.\nRobust Backup and Recovery: The system should persist data safely and\nrecover quickly from crashes.\nSecurity: Restrict access to secrets via path-based policies and protect\ndata at rest via encryption.\nAuditability: Record all read/write operations for compliance and\nmonitoring.\nScalability: The system should handle up to hundreds of thousands of\nsecrets.\nHigh Availability: Provide read replicas for scaling reads and failover\nstrategies.\n\nWe considered disk-only, disk-first, cloud-storage-only\n(like AWS S3) and cloud-storage-first solutions and decided a memory-first\nsecrets store with a reliable back-up mechanism is the best fit for SPIKE.\nDecision\nSPIKE will be an in-memory secrets store with the following characteristics:\n\nIn-Memory Data: The primary data store resides in RAM, offering\nnear-instant reads and writes.\nPeriodic Backup: An encrypted backing store (SQLite, Postgres DB, or an\nS3-compatible interface) will serve as a backup. The system uses exponential\nretries to ensure data persistence.\nHardened Container: The service is recommended to run in a hardened\ncontainer or sandbox with minimal OS surface area, reducing the likelihood of\nroot compromise.\nPath-Based Access Controls: Secrets are organized hierarchically\n(for, e.g., /secrets/acme/*). Only specific roles/tokens can access their\nrespective paths.\nReplication: A primary read-write store with read-only replicas. These\nreplicas can be promoted or re-hydrated if the primary fails.\nAuditing: All secret operations (reads, writes, deletes) are logged to\nan audit trail for compliance and investigation.\n\nRationale\n\nPerformance: In-memory data reduces latency compared to purely\ndisk-backed solutions.\nBackup Safety: The secondary backup (encrypted at rest) mitigates memory\nvolatility by allowing the system to recover from unexpected crashes or\nrestarts.\nSecurity:\n\nHardened Container: Minimizes OS-level attack surface.\nEncryption at Rest: Protects offline backups if the disk is compromised.\nPath-Based Policies: Enforces the principle of least privilege.\nAuditing: Aids in compliance and detection of unauthorized access.\nScalability: Storing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of secrets\nin memory is feasible with proper resource planning.\n\n\n\nConsequences\nPositive Outcomes\n\nPerformance Gain: Ultra-fast secrets retrieval for latency-sensitive\napplications.\nBackup Resilience: Encrypted disk backups reduce permanent data loss\nif the container restarts.\nFine-Grained Control*: Path-based policies and an internal auditing\nmechanism meet security and compliance needs.\n\nTrade-Offs and Risks\nIn contrast to our decision, here are some benefits of using a database (or a\nremote object storage) as the single source of truth:\n\nSecurity and Persistence: Using an encrypted database as the source of truth\nensures that secrets are securely stored and persist across system restarts\nor crashes. Though with frequent forced writes, the risk of data loss is\nminimized and can further be mitigated by using mechanisms like message queues.\nScalability: Databases can handle growth more effectively, allowing\nthe system to accommodate increasing amounts of secrets without a significant\nredesign. Again, this is a non-issue because if you have to store millions of\nsecrets, then you need to review your architecture anyway. In an ideal world,\nthe only secret an app needs are PKI certificates (like SVIDs) as they can\nuniquely identify the app.\nSimplicity: A single source of truth simplifies the architecture, making\nthe system easier to develop, and maintain. To counter this, SPIKE Nexus’\ncurrent architecture is simple enough to maintain and develop. We have\nabstracted exponential backoff and retry mechanisms to the storage layer, and\nonce we have adequate abstractions, the maintainability of the system will\nbe equivalent to a database-as-the-single-source-of-truth system. Besides,\nat the cost of simplicity, we lose performance and will have to implement\nadditional caching mechanisms to mitigate latency, which will add complexity\nand result in an equally complex system. There is no free lunch.\n\nHere are some other liabilities of a memory-first secrets store:\n\nCrash Consistency: Potential for a small window of data loss if the system\ncrashes just before backup.\n\nMitigation: frequent or near-synchronous write-through.\n\n\nFailover Complexity: Replication and promotion logic must be robustly\nimplemented to handle node failures seamlessly.\nMemory as an Additional Attack Surface:\n\nWhile ephemeral in-memory storage can mitigate certain disk-theft scenarios,\nmemory itself can be inspected if an attacker gains OS-level access.\nThat’s why hardening the container and ensuring proper access controls are\ncrucial. SPIKE assume the machine as the trusted boundary. So, if the\nmachine is compromised, the secrets are considered compromised as well.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKubernetes Secrets Management Best Practices\nHashiCorp Vault High-Availability Reference\nSQLite Encryption Extension Documentation\n\n\n\nADR-0021: SPIKE Keeper as a Stateless Shard Holder\nADR-0020: Switch to Zola for Documentation System\nADR-0019: Plugin-Based Storage Backend Architecture\nADR-0018: Administrative Access to SPIKE\nADR-0017: Synchronous Persistence for SPIKE Secrets Store\nADR-0016: Memory-First Secrets Store\nADR-0015: Use Singular Form for File and Package Naming\nADR-0014: Maintaining SQLite as SPIKE’s Primary Storage Backend\nADR-0013: S3-Compatible Storage as SPIKE’s Backing Store\nADR-0012: HTTP Methods for SPIKE API\nADR-0011: PostgreSQL as SPIKE’s Backing Store\nADR-0010: Session Token Storage Strategy for SPIKE Nexus\nADR-0009: Multi-Administrator Support System\nADR-0008: Administrative Access Control System\nADR-0007: Root Key Lifecycle and Management Strategy\nADR-0006: Trust Boundary Definition and Security Assumptions\nADR-0005: Use SPIFFE mTLS for Inter-Component Authentication and Communication\nADR-0004: SPIKE Keeper Minimalist Design Approach\nADR-0003: Root Key Management and Storage Strategy\nADR-0002: Use Docsify for Documentation System\nADR-0001: Display Secrets in Plain Text in SPIKE Pilot Admin CLI\n\n\n\nSPIKE System Overview\nSPIKE Security Model\nSPIKE Architectural Decision Records\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/architecture/adrs/adr-0016/","title":"ADR-0016: ADR-0015: Memory-First Secrets Store"},"https://spike.ist/architecture/adrs/adr-0017/":{"body":"ADR-0017: Synchronous Persistence for SPIKE Secrets Store\n\n\nStatus: accepted\nDate: 2025-01-25\nTags: Security, Persistence, Database, Backing-Store, Performance\n\nContext\nSPIKE is a secrets store that can use a SQLite backing store (among other\nbacking store options) to persist secrets. However, the source of truth for\nthe secrets is held in memory. SQLite is primarily used as a backup to rehydrate\nsecrets in case the secrets store crashes or needs to be recovered.\nPersistence operations were initially designed to be asynchronous, using methods\nlike AsyncSaveSecret(), to minimize blocking and improve performance. However,\nthis design has introduced unnecessary complexity, race conditions, and edge\ncases, with no significant benefit to the overall system. SQLite, being fast and\nlightweight, already offers sufficient performance without the need for\nadditional asynchronous operations.\nProblem\nThe asynchronous approach to persistence introduces the following issues:\n\nIncreased complexity: Asynchronous operations, while designed to improve\nperformance, add complexity to the system, making it harder to reason about\nand troubleshoot.\nRace conditions and edge cases: The asynchronous operations have led to\npotential race conditions, which compromise the system’s reliability.\nDebugging difficulty: To avoid the race conditions above, we could have\nuse abstractions, including Go channels. However, using Go channels and\nasynchronous operations creates challenges for debugging, as tracking state\ntransitions becomes non-trivial.\n\nGiven that SQLite is already fast enough for our needs, the performance benefit\nof using asynchronous operations is minimal. As a result, we no longer see a\nsignificant justification for using asynchronous persistence operations in\nthis context.\nDecision\n\n\nSynchronous Persistence: All database persistence operations will now be\nsynchronous.\n\nJustification: Since SQLite is sufficiently fast, and we are not seeing\nperformance bottlenecks at the database level, the simplicity of synchronous\noperations outweighs the potential complexity of maintaining asynchronous\nones.\nExpected Outcome: This decision reduces the complexity of the codebase,\neliminates the potential for race conditions, and makes the system easier\nto debug and maintain. We will continue to monitor for any performance\nimpact that might arise due to this decision.\n\n\n\nFallback to Async if Performance Issues Arise: In the unlikely event that\nwe observe significant performance issues with synchronous operations, we\nwill consider optimizing specific areas locally.\n\nOptimization Strategy: If performance degradation is observed, we will\nexplore optimization options such as local caching, batching of persistence\noperations, or fine-tuning SQLite settings. Asynchronous operations may be\nreintroduced selectively in these cases.\n\n\n\nConsequences\n\nReduced Complexity: By removing asynchronous operations, the system will\nbe simpler and easier to maintain, with fewer edge cases and race conditions\nto handle.\nPerformance Tradeoff: Synchronous operations may result in slight\nperformance degradation if there is a heavy load on the persistence layer.\nHowever, this is unlikely given the current design and SQLite’s speed.\nEasier Debugging: The synchronous model simplifies debugging, as there are\nno concurrent operations that need to be tracked.\n\nAlternatives Considered\n\nAsync Persistence: We initially considered keeping asynchronous operations\nto prevent blocking and improve performance. However, this would introduce\ncomplexity that isn’t justified by the system’s current requirements and\nSQLite’s speed.\nGo Channels for Sync Operations: Using Go channels to handle\nsynchronization in asynchronous operations was also considered, but it would\nincrease debugging complexity and not address the core issue effectively.\n\n\nThis ADR will be revisited if performance issues arise, but for now, the shift\nto synchronous persistence aligns with the goal of simplifying the codebase and\nimproving system stability.\n\n\nADR-0021: SPIKE Keeper as a Stateless Shard Holder\nADR-0020: Switch to Zola for Documentation System\nADR-0019: Plugin-Based Storage Backend Architecture\nADR-0018: Administrative Access to SPIKE\nADR-0017: Synchronous Persistence for SPIKE Secrets Store\nADR-0016: Memory-First Secrets Store\nADR-0015: Use Singular Form for File and Package Naming\nADR-0014: Maintaining SQLite as SPIKE’s Primary Storage Backend\nADR-0013: S3-Compatible Storage as SPIKE’s Backing Store\nADR-0012: HTTP Methods for SPIKE API\nADR-0011: PostgreSQL as SPIKE’s Backing Store\nADR-0010: Session Token Storage Strategy for SPIKE Nexus\nADR-0009: Multi-Administrator Support System\nADR-0008: Administrative Access Control System\nADR-0007: Root Key Lifecycle and Management Strategy\nADR-0006: Trust Boundary Definition and Security Assumptions\nADR-0005: Use SPIFFE mTLS for Inter-Component Authentication and Communication\nADR-0004: SPIKE Keeper Minimalist Design Approach\nADR-0003: Root Key Management and Storage Strategy\nADR-0002: Use Docsify for Documentation System\nADR-0001: Display Secrets in Plain Text in SPIKE Pilot Admin CLI\n\n\n\nSPIKE System Overview\nSPIKE Security Model\nSPIKE Architectural Decision Records\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/architecture/adrs/adr-0017/","title":"ADR-0017: Synchronous Persistence for SPIKE Secrets Store"},"https://spike.ist/architecture/adrs/adr-0018/":{"body":"ADR-0018: Administrative Access to SPIKE\n\n\nStatus: accepted\nData: 2025-02-20\nTags: Security, Administrative-Access, SPIFFE, IDM, DR\n\nContext\nSPIKE requires a robust and secure administrative access model to balance\noperational flexibility, security, and auditability.

Keeper as a Stateless Shard Holder\n\nStatus: accepted\nDate: 2025-03-01\nTags: Stateless, Availability, Resilience, Fault-Tolerance\n\nContext\nSPIKE Nexus is the core secret store that generates and manages the\nroot encryption key. To ensure availability and resilience, the root key\nis sharded using Shamir’s Secret Sharing Scheme and distributed to multiple\nSPIKE Keeper instances. These SPIKE Keepers are responsible for holding\ntheir respective key shards in memory to support the recovery process in\ncase SPIKE Nexus needs to reconstruct its root key.\nA key design principle in SPIKE is simplicity and minimalism:\nThe SPIKE Keeper component should remain as lightweight as possible,\navoiding unnecessary complexity such as awareness of Nexus, complex\nconfiguration, or inter-Keeper communication. Instead, SPIKE Nexus should\nmaintain full control over key management while leveraging SPIKE Keepers\nas dumb storage units for key shards.\nDecision\nSPIKE Keepers remain stateless and unaware of SPIKE Nexus:\n\nSPIKE Keepers do not need to know which SPIKE Nexus instance they are\nserving.\nThey store their assigned key shard in-memory and do not persist any\nstate.\n\nZero configuration for SPIKE Keepers:\n\nSPIKE Keepers have no static configuration files or runtime parameters\nrelated to SPIKE Nexus.\nDeployment should be as simple as running a SPIKE Keeper instance without\nadditional setup.\n\nSPIKE Nexus is responsible for lifecycle management:\n\nSPIKE Nexus generates the root key, sharding it and distributing the\npieces to SPIKE Keepers.\nSPIKE Nexus polls Keepers to check their health and ensure that a quorum\nis available.\nIf a SPIKE Keeper goes down and restarts, SPIKE Nexus is responsible\nfor rehydrating it with the correct key shard.\n\nPolling-based health monitoring and rehydration:\n\nSPIKE Keepers do not initiate communication with SPIKE Nexus.\n\nInstead, SPIKE Nexus periodically queries SPIKE Keepers for their\nstatus.\n\n\nIf a SPIKE Keeper is found to be empty (e.g., after a restart),\nSPIKE Nexus reassigns the missing shard.\n\nRationale\n\nSecurity: SPIKE Keepers hold only a single shard; which is not adequate\nto regenerate the root key. They are never aware of other SPIKE Keepers\nor the full key. This limits their attack surface.\nSimplicity: By eliminating configuration and inter-service dependencies,\nSPIKE Keepers become easy to deploy, replace, and scale.\nAvailability: The polling and rehydration mechanism ensures that\nSPIKE Nexus* can automatically recover lost shards without manual\nintervention.\nFault Tolerance: Stateless SPIKE Keepers can be replaced without\nrequiring reconfiguration or coordination with other components.\n\nConsequences\nPositive\n\nSimplifies Keeper deployment and operation.\nImproves security by ensuring Keepers never hold full knowledge of the system.\nEnhances reliability by making Keepers easily replaceable without system-wide\nimpact.\nReduces operational burden since SPIKE Nexus automatically manages the\nlifecycle of SPIKE Keepers and their shards.\n\nNegative\n\nSPIKE Nexus must handle additional logic for polling, health monitoring,\nand rehydration.\nSPIKE Keepers depend on SPIKE Nexus for their purpose, making them\nentirely reliant on SPIKE Nexus’ availability.\n\nAlternatives Considered\nSPIKE Keepers as Stateful Services:\n\nRejected because it adds complexity and requires persistent storage.\nWould introduce additional configuration and synchronization challenges.\n\nSPIKE Keepers Managing Their Own Shards:\n\nRejected as it violates the principle of keeping SPIKE Keepers unaware\nof the full system state.\nWould require SPIKE Keepers to store metadata about SPIKE Nexus,\nincreasing complexity and risk.\n\nPush-Based Shard Distribution Instead of Polling:\n\nRejected because it would require SPIKE Keepers to maintain knowledge of\nSPIKE Nexus.\nPolling ensures that SPIKE Keepers can remain stateless and unaware of\nthe system topology.\n\nDecision Outcome\nThis decision is final unless significant operational issues arise.

Once the machine is\ncompromised, hardening SPIKE components will provide diminishing returns.\nIn that regard, both physical, and OS-level security are important.\nFor example, when the machine is compromised, an attacker with sufficient\nprivileges can observe and control the memory of SPIKE Nexus, or\nSPIKE Keeper; they can inject their counterfeit workloads; they can modify\nSPIRE and create their own registration entries\nIt’s also worth noticing that, since SPIKE Keeper backs ups the root key\nin memory, if SPIKE Keeper is compromised, the machine can be considered\ncompromised.\nFor containerized deployments, both SPIKE Nexus and SPIKE Keeper\nshall be hardened.\nThreat Model Exceptions\nThe following are not considered part of SPIKE’s threat model:\n\nProtecting against the control of the storage backend: Any storage backend\nis considered untrustworthy by SPIKE, so any data saved in the storage\nbackend is encrypted at rest, and only SPIKE Nexus can decrypt it.\nAn attacker can perform arbitrary operations against the storage backend,\nIt is not SPIKE’s responsibility to protect the storage backend itself;\nSPIKE only ensures that an attacker accessing the storage backend cannot\nreveal the data stored there.\nProtecting against memory analysis of running system components: If an\nattacker can inspect the memory state of any component, then they already have\ndirect access to the machine (which is our primary trust boundary). If this\nhappens, then the confidentiality of the data may be compromised. Preventing\nmemory analysis is a common system security best practice, and it is out\nof scope for SPIKE to enforce such measures.\n\nSystem administrators should implement the following security measures to\nprevent memory analysis:\n\nSet /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope to 2 or 3:\n\nValue 2 restricts ptrace to root-only access\nValue 3 disables ptrace completely, offering maximum security\n\n\nMake this setting permanent by adding kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 2 to\n/etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf\nConsider using SELinux or AppArmor profiles to further restrict\nprocess debugging capabilities\nIf running in a container, ensure the container runtime is configured to\ndisable ptrace capabilities (e.g.,\nusing --security-opt=no-new-privileges in Docker)\nRegular audit of processes with CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability, as this can\nbypass ptrace restrictions\n\n\n\n\nProtecting against malicious code execution on the underlying host system.\nThis is again the system administrator’s responsibility. SPIKE cannot\nprotect against malicious code execution as that ability likely requires\nadministrative privileges, which should be avoided for SPIKE components\nin the first place to prevent privilege escalation.\nProtecting against the underlying system’s flaws. The systems shall be\nup-to-date with respect to dependencies, properly secured, monitored, and\nhardened.\nProtecting against ill intent of SPIKE super admins: SPIKE assumes\ntrust for super administrators. Any malicious actions performed by super\nadmins, such as abusing their elevated privileges, are considered out of\nscope for SPIKE’s threat model. It is the organization’s responsibility\nto enforce proper checks, balances, and monitoring mechanisms for super\nadmin activities.\nProtecting against SPIKE administrators supplying vulnerable or malicious\nconfiguration data. This includes both intentional or unintentional\nmisconfiguration—an administrator is supposed to know what they are doing.\nAny data provided as configuration values to SPIKE should be\nvalidated. Misconfiguration of SPIKE, or SPIFFE can result in the\ncompromise of the confidentiality or the integrity of the data stored.\n\nThe Backing Store is Untrusted\nSince the storage backend resides outside the trusted boundary, SPIKE\ntreats it as untrusted and encrypts data before sending it. This ensures that\neven if a malicious attacker gains access to the storage backend, the data\nremains secure, as it can only be decrypted by SPIKE Nexus.\nAdditionally, the storage backend serves as a durable, persistent layer,\nensuring data availability across application crashes and server restarts.\nKeeper Shard Distribution and Disaster Recovery\nSPIKE uses SPIKE Keepers, which are apps responsible for storing\nShamir shards of the root key. Both the root key and the\nshards are always in memory and never persisted to disk.\nSPIKE Nexus can establish a SPIFFE-based mTLS connection to request a shard\nfrom a SPIKE Keeper, enabling the system to auto-recover itself.\nThe security model allows for different levels of redundancy and control:\n\nA typical setup could involve three SPIKE Keeper instances. No single\nshare can reconstruct the root key alone, ensuring security. However, multiple\nshares can be combined to restore the system when needed.\nSPIKE Nexus often automatically recovers itself from crashes using\nSPIKE Keepers. However, for the unlikely case of a total system crash,\neach administrator can hold one of these shares and use spike restore to\nrestore the system back to normal. Since, a single shard cannot recreate\nthe root key we are mitigating risk by distributing trust.\nFor those less concerned with strict separation, an alternative approach\ncould involve storing both shares on a single thumb drive or distributing\ntwo shares across separate thumb drives in different safes. This trade-off\nbalances security with recovery convenience.\n\nUltimately, the design offers flexibility, allowing organizations to choose\ntheir preferred level of security while considering the operational impact of\ndisaster recovery.\nKey Management\n\nThe system assumes a long-lived, well-guarded, initial root key.\n\nThe root key will be periodically rotated, but still, it will be\nlong-lived.\n\n\nThe root key is automatically generated by SPIKE Nexus, and it’s\nnever stored on disk in plain text (i.e., it always lives in memory)\nAn administrator with adequate privileges can use spike recover to save\nShamir Shards in an encrypted medium out-of-band for future\nbreak-the-glass disaster recovery.\nRoot key rotation will also re-encrypt the secrets.\n\nWorkload Access\nWorkloads can securely access their secrets and perform lifecycle operations\n(e.g., create, delete, and modify secrets) based on access policies defined\nby an administrator (using the spike policy command). These policies\nspecify what a workload is allowed to do with the secrets managed by\nSPIKE Nexus.\n\nDefault Deny: By default, access to SPIKE Nexus is prohibited. Only\nsuper administrators have full access by default.\nPolicy Enforcement: Workloads require a valid, explicitly defined policy\nto perform any lifecycle operation on paths that contain secrets.\nControlled Operations: Operations such as creating, deleting, or modifying\nsecrets are strictly governed by the access policies.\nAccess Scoping: Policies can define the scope and level of access (e.g.,\nread-only or full access) on specific secret paths for each workload.\n\nThis ensures that workloads only access or modify the secrets they are\nexplicitly permitted to, in accordance with their predefined policies.\nAdministrative Access\nAlthough SPIKE uses policy-based access to secrets and administrative\noperations, SPIKE Nexus recognizes certain builtin SPIFFE IDs and assigns\nthem predefined roles:\n\nAdministrative access is granted using special SPIFFE IDs:\n\nspiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/superuser: Super Admin. Can do\neverything but recovery or restore operations.\nspiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/recover: Recovery user. Can only\nrecover the root key shards to the local file system.\nspiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/restore: Restore user. Can only\nrestore the root key by providing one shard at a time.\n\n\n\nThis gives us the flexibility to have separate users own distinct operational\nresponsibilities. For example, a specific operator may only restore the system\nupon an unexpected crash, but they may not have the right to define access\npolicies for secrets.\nThis separation also provides better auditability.\n\nOnce the system is initialized, accidental re-initialization is prevented.\n\nFor emergencies the admin user can use an out-of-band script to\n“factory-reset” SPIKE.\n\n\n\nMulti-Admin Support\nOther than the three predefined roles (superuser, recover, restore), named\nadmin access to the system would only be possible using an external identity\nmanager such as an OIDC provider.\nSPIKE focuses on secure and efficient secret storage. It delegates access\nand identity management to established standards like OIDC, keeping\nauthentication concerns out of scope.\n\n\nSPIKE System Overview\nSPIKE Security Model\nSPIKE Architectural Decision Records\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nCommunity\nSPIKE Architecture\nOperations\nTracking\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/architecture/security-model/","title":"SPIKE Security Model"},"https://spike.ist/architecture/system-overview/":{"body":"SPIKE System Overview\nThis document provides an overview of SPIKE, a SPIFFE-native\nSecrets Management solution. It is designed to ensure secure storage, recovery,\nand management of sensitive data with a focus on simplicity, reliability,\nand scalability for production environments.\nSPIKE Components\nSPIKE (Secure Production Identity for Key Encryption) is a secrets\nmanagement system build on top of a SPIFFE (Secure Production\nIdentity Framework for Everyone) identity control plane, consisting of three\ncomponents:\n\nSPIKE Nexus (./nexus): The secrets store\nSPIKE Pilot (./spike): The CLI\nSPIKE Keeper (./keeper): The redundancy mechanism\n\nThe system provides high availability for secret storage with a manual recovery\nmechanism in case of irrecoverable failure.\nIdentity Control Plane\nThe following diagram shows how SVIDs are assigned to SPIKE\ncomponents and other actors in the system. SVIDs, or SPIFFE-Verifiable\nIdentity Documents, are x.509 Digital Certificates, that contain\na SPIFFE ID in their SAN (Subject Alternative Name)\nThe following diagram illustrates how SPIFFE identities are distributed\nacross different SPIKE system components using SPIRE as the identity\ncontrol plane.\n\n\n    \n        \n        Establishing the Identity Control Plane.\n    \n\nIn a SPIKE deployment, SPIRE acts as the central authority that issues\nSVIDs to different workloads:\n\nApplications who need to manage secret lifecycles stored in SPIKE Nexus.\nSPIKE Infrastructure components:\n\nSPIKE Nexus\nSPIKE Pilot\nMultiple SPIKE Keeper instances.\n\n\n\nEach component receives its own SVID, which serves as a\ncryptographically-verifiable identity document. These SVIDs allow the\ncomponents to:\n\nProve their identity to other services\nEstablish secure, authenticated mTLS connections\nAccess resources they’re authorized to use\nCommunicate securely with other components in the system\n\nThe dashed boxes represent distinct security and deployment boundaries.\nSPIRE provides identity management capabilities that span across these\ntrust boundaries. This architecture allows administrative operations to be\nperformed on a hardened, secured SPIRE Server instance (shown in the top\nyellow box), while restricting direct access to sensitive operations\n(like creating SPIRE Server registration entries) from users and applications\nlocated in other trust boundaries.\n\nZero Trust FTW!\nThe approached described here is a common pattern in zero-trust\narchitectures, where every service needs to have a strong, verifiable\nidentity regardless of its network location.\nThis approach is more secure than traditional methods like shared secrets or\nnetwork-based security, as each workload gets its own unique, short-lived\nidentity that can be automatically rotated and revoked if needed.\n\nSPIKE Component Interaction\nThe following diagram depicts how various SPIKE components interact with\neach other:\n\n\n    \n        \n        Secret Management in SPIKE.\n    \n\nAt the top level, there’s an Application that consumes secrets through an\nmTLS (mutual TLS) connection to SPIKE Nexus. The application will likely use\nthe SPIKE Developer SDK to consume secrets without having\nto implement the underlying SPIFFE mTLS wiring.\nThe secrets are created/managed through:\nAn administrative user interacting with SPIKE Pilot through a command line\ninterface (the CLI is the spike binary itself).\nThen, SPIKE Pilot communicates with SPIKE Nexus over mTLS to create\nsecrets.\nSPIKE Nexus is the central management point for secrets. It’s our\nsecrets store.\nAt the bottom of the diagram, multiple SPIKE Keepers connect to\nSPIKE Nexus via mTLS. Each SPIKE Keeper holds a single\nShamir Secret Share (shard) of the root key that\nSPIKE Nexus maintains in memory.\nThis design ensures that compromising any individual SPIKE Keeper cannot\nbreach the system, as a single shard is insufficient to reconstruct the\nroot key.\nThe system’s security can be tuned by configuring both the total number of\nSPIKE Keepers and the **threshold **of required shards needed to reconstruct\nthe root key.\nDuring system bootstrapping, SPIKE Nexus distributes these shards to the\nSPIKE Keepers. If SPIKE Nexus crashes or restarts, it automatically\nrecovers by requesting shards from a threshold number of healthy\nSPIKE Keepers to reconstruct the root key.\nThis mechanism provides automatic resiliency and redundancy without requiring\nmanual intervention or “unsealing” operations that are common in other secret\nmanagement solutions.\nThe system’s security and availability can be tuned by configuring both the\ntotal number of SPIKE Keepers and the threshold of required shards\nneeded to reconstruct the root key. This flexibility allows implementors to\nbalance their security requirements against operational needs–from basic\nredundancy to highly paranoid configurations requiring many SPIKE Keepers\nto be healthy.\nBoth the individual shards and the assembled root key are exclusively held in\nmemory and NEVER persisted to disk, forming a core aspect of SPIKE’s security\nmodel.\nThe system uses mTLS (mutual TLS) throughout for secure communication between\ncomponents, which ensures:\n\nAll communications are encrypted\nBoth sides of each connection authenticate each other\nThe system maintains a high level of security for secret management\n\nSPIKE Nexus Root Key Sharding\nThe following diagram shows how the SPIKE Nexus root key is split into\nshards and then delivered to SPIKE Keepers:\n\n\n    \n        \n        Secret Nexus root key sharding.\n    \n\nThe SPIKE Nexus has a root key that’s essential for encrypting the\nbacking store. This root key is split into Shamir shards based\non a configurable number and threshold. There should be as many keepers as\nthe created shards.\nThe key advantage of using Shamir sharding specifically (versus other forms\nof key splitting) is that it’s mathematically secure: The shards are\ncreated using polynomial interpolation, meaning:\n\nEach shard contains no meaningful information about the original key by itself\nYou need a threshold number of shards to reconstruct the key\nThe system can be configured to require any M of N shards to reconstruct the\nroot key (e.g., any 2 of 3, or 3 of 5, etc.)\n\nThis provides both security and fault tolerance: The system can continue\noperating even if some SPIKE Keepers become temporarily unavailable, as\nlong as the threshold number of shards remain accessible.\nSPIKE Nexus Init Flow\nThe following diagram depicts SPIKE Nexus initial bootstrapping flow:\n\n\n    \n        \n        Secret Nexus bootstrapping.\n    \n\nWhen SPIKE Nexus is configured to use an in-memory backing store, we\ndon’t need SPIKE Keeper because the database is in SPIKE Nexus’s memory\nand there is nothing to recover if SPIKE Nexus crashes. This is a convenient\nsetup to use for development purposes.\nWhen SPIKE Nexus is configured to use a persistent backing store (like\nSQLite), however, then it will follow two paths.\n\nIf SPIKE Nexus has bootstrapped before, then it has just crashed. Which\nmeans, it has lost its root key. So, it will try to recover its\nroot key by requesting shards from the SPIKE Keepers.\nIf, otherwise, it’s the first time SPIKE Nexus is bootstrapping, then\nwe compute a secure root key, initialize the backing store with that\nroot key. Split the root key into Shamir shards, and send those\nshards to relevant SPIKE Keeper instances.\n\nRegardless of the above flow, there is an ongoing operation (shown in the\nbottom part of the diagram) that runs as a separate goroutine.\n\nAt regular intervals, if SPIKE Nexus happens to have a root key, it\ncomputes Shamir shards out of it, and dispatches these shards\nto the SPIKE Keepers.\n\nThis flow establishes a secure boot process that handles both initial setup and\nsubsequent startups. The system ensures the root key is either properly\nrecovered from existing shards or securely generated and distributed when\nstarting fresh.\nThere is one edge case though: When there is a total system crash, and SPIKE\nKeepers don’t have any shards in their memory, then you’ll need a manual\nrecovery.\nThis event is highly unlikely, as deploying a sufficient number of SPIKE\nKeepers with proper geographic distribution significantly reduces the\nprobability of them all crashing simultaneously. Since SPIKE Keepers are\ndesigned to operate independently and without requiring intercommunication,\nfailures caused by systemic issues are minimized. By ensuring redundancy across\ndiverse geographic locations, even large-scale outages or localized failures are\nhighly improbable to impact all SPIKE Keepers at once.\nThat being said, unexpected failures can occur, and the disaster recovery\nprocedure for these situations is described in the next section.\nSPIKE “break-the-glass” Disaster Recovery\n\nNeed a Runbook?\nThe SPIKE Recovery Procedures page contains\nstep-by-step instructions to follow during, before, and a disaster occurs.\nYou will need to prepare beforehand so that you can recover the root\nkey when the system fails to automatically recover it from SPIKE Keepers.\n\nThe following diagram outline SPIKE’s manual disaster recovery procedure.\nYou can open the picture on a new tab for an enlarged version of it.\n\n\n    \n        \n        SPIKE Manual disaster recovery flow.\n    \n\nPreventive Backup\n\nRun spik recover as Soon as You Can\nYou must back up the root key shards using spike recover BEFORE a\ndisaster strikes.\nThis is like having a spare key stored in a safe place before you lose your\nmain keys. Without this proactive backup step, there would be nothing to\nrecover from in a catastrophic failure.\n\nThis operation need to be done BEFORE any disaster; ideally, shortly after\ndeploying SPIKE.\nHere is how the flow goes:\n\nThe Operator runs spike recover using SPIKE Pilot.\nSPIKE Pilot saves the recovery shards on the home directory of the system/\nThe Operator encrypts and stores these shards in a secure medium, and securely\nerases the copies generated as an output to spike recover.\n\nWhen later recovery is needed, the Operator will provide these shards to\nSPIKE to restore the system back to its working state.\nDisaster Recovery\nWhen disaster strikes (shown in the red box):\n\nSPIKE Nexus and SPIKE Keepers have simultaneously crashed and restarted.\nSPIKE Nexus has lost its root key\nSPIKE Keepers don’t have enough shards\nThus, automatic recovery is impossible and the system requires manual\nrecovery.\n\nIn that case, the Operator uses spike restore to provide the previously\nbacked-up shards one at a time\n\nSPIKE Pilot forwards the entered shard to SPIKE Nexus\nSystem acknowledges and tracks progress of shard restoration returning\nthe amount of shards received, and the number of shards remaining to restore\nthe root key.\n\nSystem Restoration\nOnce enough shards are provided, SPIKE Nexus reconstructs the root key.\nA separate goroutine redistributes shards to SPIKE Keepers and the System\nreturns to normal operation.\nSPIKE Components\nHere is an overview of each SPIKE component:\nSPIKE Nexus\n\nSPIKE Nexus is the primary component responsible for secrets management.\nIt creates and manages the root encryption key.\nIt handles secret encryption and decryption.\nIt syncs the root key’s Shamir Shards with SPIKE\nKeeperss. These shards then can be used to recover SPIKE Nexus\nupon a crash.\nIt provides an RESTful mTLS API for secret lifecycle management,\npolicy management, admin operations, and disaster recovery.\n\nSPIKE Keeper\n\nIt is designed to be simple and reliable.\nIt does one thing, and does it well.\nIts only goal is to keep a Shamir Shard in memory.\nBy design, it does not have any knowledge about its peer SPIKE Keepers,\nnor SPIKE Nexus. It doesn’t require any configuration to be brought up.\nThis makes it simple to operate, replace, scale, replicate.\nIt enables automatic recovery if SPIKE Nexus crashes.\n\nSince SPIKE Keeper only contains a single shard, its compromise will not\ncompromise the system.\nThe more keepers you have, the more reliable and secure your SPIKE\ndeployment will be. We recommend 5 SPIKE Keeper instances with a\nshard-generation threshold of 3, for production deployments.\nCheck out SPIKE Production Hardening Guide for more\ndetails.\nSPIKE Pilot\n\nIt is the CLI to the system (i.e., the spike binary that you see\nin the examples).\nIt converts CLI commands to RESTful mTLS API calls to SPIKE Nexus.\n\nSPIKE Pilot is the only management entry point to the system.\nThus, deleting/disabling/removing SPIKE Pilot reduces the attack surface\nof the system since admin operations will not be possible without\nSPIKE Pilot.\nSimilarly, revoking the SPIRE Server registration of SPIKE Pilot’s\nSVID (once SPIKE Pilot is no longer needed) will effectively block\nadministrative access to the system, improving the overall security posture.\nBuiltin SPIFFE IDs\nSPIKE Nexus recognizes the following builtin SPIFFE IDS:\n\nspiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/superuser: Super Admin\nspiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/recover: Recovery Admin\nspiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/restore: Restore Admin\n\nYou can check out the **Administrative Access section of SPIKE security\nmodel for more\ninformation about these roles.\n\n\nSPIKE System Overview\nSPIKE Security Model\nSPIKE Architectural Decision Records\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nCommunity\nSPIKE Architecture\nOperations\nTracking\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/architecture/system-overview/","title":"System Overview"},"https://spike.ist/community/":{"body":"Share your knowledge and engage in meaningful discussions.

Additionally,\nSPIFFE’s automatic identity rotation and short-lived cryptographic\nidentities enhance security and resilience, making it an ideal foundation\nfor a zero-trust secrets management system.\nWhy Not Use Kubernetes Secrets\nOne of the most misunderstood aspects of Kubernetes secrets is that\nKubernetes secrets are not truly secrets. While Kubernetes provides a\nmechanism to store and manage sensitive information, it is not a dedicated\nsecrets management solution.\nHere’s why relying on Kubernetes secrets can be problematic:\nLimited Scope &amp; Portability\nIf a service outside Kubernetes—or in another cluster—needs access to a\nKubernetes secret, it introduces significant authentication and authorization\nchallenges.\nKubernetes Secrets are designed to work within a single cluster, making it\ndifficult to share them securely across different environments\n(e.g., multiple clusters, bare-metal infrastructure, or cloud-based services).\nThis limitation can lead to inconsistent security policies and fragmented secret\nmanagement practices.\nA robust secrets management strategy should consider secrets’ scope beyond a\nsingle cluster.\nStatic Nature of the Secrets\nKubernetes secrets are static once created. They are stored in etcd and\ninjected into pods at startup, meaning updates require manual\nintervention—modifying the secret, redeploying affected applications, and\nensuring no stale or expired secrets remain in use.\nUpdating a Kubernetes Secret does not automatically notify or reload the\nworkloads consuming it. Applications typically need to be restarted or\nre-deployed to pick up the new secret, adding operational complexity and\npotential downtime if not managed carefully.\nThis lack of flexibility introduces security risks and operational overhead.\nSecurity and Governance Limitations\nKubernetes Secrets are governed by Kubernetes RBAC. Using Kubernetes Secrets, it\ncan be tricky to enforce a platform-agnostic security policy that spans\nmultiple environments. This often leads to a fragmented governance and\npotential misconfigurations.\nA dedicated secrets manager offers dynamic cross-environment compatibility,\nand stronger security controls—making it a better choice for modern,\ndistributed architectures.\nKubernetes Secrets Are Not Encrypted By Default\nKubernetes Secrets are stored in etcd, and unless encryption at rest is\nexplicitly enabled, they are stored in plaintext. This means that anyone with\naccess to etcd (including certain privileged users or attackers who compromise\nthe cluster) can retrieve sensitive data without needing Kubernetes API access.\nMoreover, even with encryption at rest, the security model of Kubernetes Secrets\nremains weaker than a dedicated secrets store. While encryption prevents direct\nretrieval of plaintext secrets from etcd storage, an attacker with right\nprivileges can get the encryption key. Additionally, the Kubernetes API must\ndecrypt secrets when serving them to workloads, meaning any user or process\nwith sufficient API permissions can still retrieve secrets in plaintext.\nSo not only etcd itself, but also API-layer access is also a risk factor\nin enforcing the security of Kubernetes Secrets.\nWhen Are Kubernetes Secrets Useful?\nDespite these challenges, Kubernetes Secrets can still be useful in simple,\ncluster-contained workloads where:\n\nSecrets do not need frequent rotation.\nAll applications consuming the secrets reside in the same cluster.\nRBAC policies are well-configured to prevent accidental exposure.\n\nHowever, for any multi-cluster, dynamic, or zero-trust architecture, a\ndedicated secrets management solution is a better approach—providing\nfine-grained access control, cross-environment compatibility, and stronger\nsecurity guarantees.\nThat part taken care of, we can get our hands dirty with SPIKE in the\nSPIKE Quickstart Guide.\n\n\nAbout SPIKE\nSPIKE Quickstart Guide\nAlpha Release Notice\nConfiguring SPIKE\nSPIKE CLI\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nCommunity\nSPIKE Architecture\nOperations\nTracking\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/getting-started/about/","title":"About SPIKE"},"https://spike.ist/getting-started/alpha-release-notice/":{"body":"🚨 Alpha Release Notice 🚨\nThis project is currently in the Alpha stage.

SPIRE\nis an implementation of the SPIFFE specification, providing a robust\nframework for workload attestation and cryptographic identity issuance within\ndistributed systems.\nConfiguring SPIRE for production is critical to ensure the security and\nreliability of SPIKE. An improperly configured SPIRE deployment can leave\ngaps in the identity management process, potentially exposing sensitive\ncryptographic operations to unauthorized access.\nHere are some key steps to harden SPIRE for production:\nSecure SPIRE Server and Agent Communication\n\nUse mutual TLS (mTLS) for all communication between SPIRE Server, SPIRE\nAgents, and workloads.\nConfigure SPIRE Server and Agents to only accept connections from trusted\nsources.\n\nSet Up Attestation Policies\n\nDefine strict attestation policies to ensure that only trusted workloads are\nissued SPIFFE IDs. // TODO: explain what that means in the context of SPIKE.\nUtilize the node attestation plugins (e.g., AWS IID, Kubernetes) to verify\nthe identity of nodes running SPIRE Agents.\n\nLimit Permissions\n\nRun SPIRE Server and Agents with the minimum required permissions.\nUse dedicated non-root users for running SPIRE processes.\n\nSecure SPIRE Database\nIf the SPIRE Server is configured to use an external database for\npersistence, ensure that the database is:\n\nEncrypted at rest and in transit.\nRestricted to access only from SPIRE Server.\n\nConfigure Registration Entries\n\nCreate granular SPIFFE ID registration entries for specific workloads.\nAvoid using wildcard matching in selectors to reduce the risk of impersonation\nattacks.\n\nYou can find sample scripts that creates registration entries under the\n./hack folder:\n\n./hack/spire-server-entry-recover-register.sh\n./hack/spire-server-entry-spike-register.sh\n./hack/spire-server-entry-restore-register.sh\n\nHarden SPIRE Deployment on Kubernetes\nIf you have deployed SPIRE on Kubernetes:\n\nUse Kubernetes Pod Security Standards, Network Policies,\nand RBAC to restrict SPIRE Server and SPIRE Agent access.\nLimit SPIRE components to trusted namespaces and nodes.\n\nRegularly Rotate Certificates\n\nConfigure SPIRE to rotate workload certificates and keys frequently.\nAutomate the process to ensure timely certificate renewal without manual\nintervention.\n\nEnable Logging and Monitoring\n\nConfigure logging for SPIRE Server and Agents to capture suspicious\nactivity.\nMonitor logs for failed authentication attempts, unauthorized access, or\nother anomalies.\n\nPerform Regular Audits\n\nConduct regular security audits and penetration tests on the SPIRE deployment.\nReview registration entries and attestation policies to ensure they align\nwith security best practices.\n\nUpdate SPIRE Regularly\n\nKeep SPIRE updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security\npatches and new features.\n\nBy carefully configuring and hardening SPIRE, you ensure that\nSPIKE’s SPIFFE-based identity control plane is robust, reliable, and\nsecured against potential threats, forming the foundation for SPIKE’s secure\noperations in production environments.\nIsolate SPIRE Server\nYou are encouraged to isolate the SPIRE Server from other SPIKE components.\nBy doing this, a separate administrator can access the SPIRE Server and\ncreate SPIKE registration entries, whereas other SPIKE users, including\nthe SPIKE Pilot superadmin, will not have the ability to create SPIRE Server\nregistration entries.\nThis approach aligns with zero-trustbest practices by enforcing separation\nof privileges and reducing the risk of privilege misuse or escalation.\nFor bare-metal or VM deployments, it is recommended to run the\nSPIRE Server on its own dedicated machine, separate from SPIKE Keeper\nand SPIKE Nexus machines. This ensures that any compromise of those\nmachines does not directly impact the SPIRE Server.\nFor Kubernetes deployments, it is a good practice to run the SPIRE\nServer outside the Kubernetes cluster on an ultra-hardened system. This\nprotects the SPIRE Server from potential security breaches or privilege\nescalations within the Kubernetes cluster.\nSPIKE General Hardening Guidelines\nThe guidelines covered in this section apply to all SPIKE components\nincluding SPIKE Nexus, SPIKE Keeper, and SPIKE Pilot.\nUser Privileges\n\nFor bare-metal deployments:\n\nRun SPIKE Nexus and SPIKE Keeper processes as non-root users.\nConfigure them to have minimal permissions.\nKeep OS and security packages up-to-date.\n\n\nFor Kubernetes deployments:\n\nDisable privilege escalation for containers by setting\nallowPrivilegeEscalation: false in your PodSecurity configuration.\nUse Kubernetes Pod Security Admission or equivalent policies to enforce\nsecurity constraints.\nLimit the use of privileged containers (privileged: false) wherever\nfeasible.\nConfigure strict NetworkPolicies to restrict communication between Pods.\nAlways use read-only root filesystems for the containers\n(readOnlyRootFilesystem: true).\nSpecify non-root runAsUser and runAsGroup in the container’s\nsecurity context.\n\n\nFor Docker deployments:\n\nPrevent containers from running in privileged mode using the\n--privileged=false option.\nUse --read-only to enforce read-only filesystem access for the container.\nLimit container capabilities by setting the --cap-drop option to drop all\nunnecessary capabilities.\nAvoid mapping the Docker socket into containers for security-sensitive\nworkloads.\nImplement user namespaces with --userns-remap to isolate containers from\nthe host’s root user.\n\n\n\nSecurity Modules\n\nFor Linux bare-metal SPIKE installations, consider enabling and\nconfiguring AppArmor and SELinux.\nSet up mandatory access control.\nEnforce strict process isolation.\n\nNetwork Security\n\nRestrict network access to essential ports/protocols.\nImplement network segmentation.\nConfigure strict firewall rules.\nConduct regular network security audits.\n\nLogging and Monitoring\n\nSet up comprehensive process logging\nMonitor for unauthorized access attempts\nImplement real-time alerting\nRegular log analysis and review\n\nSecurity Auditing\n\nRegular system configuration audits\nSecurity control effectiveness reviews\nPeriodic penetration testing\nConfiguration compliance checks\n\nBinary Integrity\nOfficial SPIKE binaries are published with SHA-256 checksums. Make sure\nyou implement SHA hash verification when using SPIKE distributions to\nensure that you are using original, tested, validated, and approved binaries.\nIn addition, it’s useful to have regular binary integrity checks too, to ensure\nthat binaries are not replaced with malicious code.\nOne more thing you are encouraged to do is to include SPIKE Nexus,\nSPIKE Keeper, and SPIKE Pilot’s binary SHA hashes while registering\nthem to SPIRE Server. Here’s an example:\n\nThis way, if the binary changes, SPIRE Server will not assign it an SVID,\nand the rest of the system will not trust it and stop communicating with it,\neffectively securing the SPIKE components by totally isolating and\nkeeping out the untrusted binary.\nDefense in Depth\n\nImplement multiple layers of security controls.\nHave regular security control reviews.\nHave a comprehensive security documentation.\n\nHow th Root Key Is Protected in SPIKE\nIn SPIKE, the root key is essential for encrypting secrets within the\ncentral store, SPIKE Nexus. To prevent any single entity from having full\naccess to this key, SPIKE uses Shamir’s Secret Sharing to divide the\nroot key into multiple shares. These shares are distributed among\nSPIKE Keepers, ensuring that the root key can only be reconstructed when a\nsufficient number of shares are combined.\nThis approach enhances security by requiring collaboration among multiple\ntrusted components to access the root key.\nShamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) is a cryptographic method that divides a\nsecret into parts, distributing them among participants. The secret can only be\nreconstructed when a minimum number of parts (the threshold) are combined.\nThis ensures that partial knowledge of the secret does not compromise its\nsecurity.\nHardening SPIKE Keeper for Production\nSPIKE Keepers play a critical role in managing sensitive cryptographic\nmaterial, specifically handling shards that are used to generate the\nroot key that SPIKE Nexus uses to encrypt its backing store.\nAs described in the SPIKE Security Model, protecting your system\nagainst memory analysis is important, not only for SPIKE, but for any\napplication you may be running n your system.\nSystem administrators should implement the following security measures to\nprevent memory analysis:\n\nSet /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope to 2 or 3:\n\nValue 2 restricts ptrace to root-only access\nValue 3 disables ptrace completely, offering maximum security\n\n\nMake this setting permanent by adding kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 2 to\n/etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf\nConsider using SELinux or AppArmor profiles to further restrict\nprocess debugging capabilities\nIf running in a container, ensure the container runtime is configured to\ndisable ptrace capabilities (e.g.,\nusing --security-opt=no-new-privileges in Docker)\nRegular audit of processes with CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability, as this can\nbypass ptrace restrictions\n\nBy default, SPIKE Keepers are protected by multiple layers of security:\n\nmTLS API Protection: All SPIKE Keeper APIs are protected by mutual\nTLS (mTLS), preventing direct access to the shards through the API interface.\nSPIFFE Attestation: SPIKE Keepers implement SPIFFE attestation\nwhich verifies the authenticity of SPIKE Keeper binaries by validating\nattributes like the SHA hash, unix user id, and path. This prevents attackers\nfrom running malicious keeper processes, as they would fail the attestation\ncheck.\n\nAlthough these protections are in place, they need to be properly configured to\ntake effect. For example, a misconfigured SPIRE Server registration entry or\nusing a user with elevated privileges to run the SPIKE Keeper binaries may\nresult in a security breach (see the “hardening SPIRE for production” section\nbefore for details)\nHardening SPIKE Nexus for Production\nSPIKE Nexus serves as the central secrets store, maintaining sensitive data\nin memory and using encrypted storage for persistence. Due to its critical role\nin managing secrets, special attention must be paid to its security\nconfiguration.\nMemory Protection\n\nThe ptrace and yama recommendations for SPIKE Keepers covered in\nthe previous section also applies to SPIKE Nexus. Protect SPIKE\nNexus’s memory against external analysis.\nConfigure memory restrictions to prevent swapping:\n\nSet vm.swappiness=0 in sysctl configuration\nUse mlock to lock memory pages and prevent them from being swapped\nIf using systemd, set LimitMEMLOCK=infinity in the service file\n\n\nEnable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR):\n\nEnsure /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space is set to 2\n\n\nImplement memory scrubbing:\n\nConfigure automatic memory wiping for deallocated memory\nUse secure memory allocation practices for sensitive data\n\n\n\nBacking Store Security\n\nConfigure secure backup procedures:\n\nEncrypt all backups\nImplement strict access controls on backup storage\nRegular backup integrity verification\n\n\nMonitor backing store access:\n\nLog all access attempts\nImplement alerting for unusual access patterns\nRegular audit of access logs\n\n\n\nResource Management\n\nSet appropriate resource limits:\n\nConfigure memory limits based on expected load\nSet CPU quotas to prevent resource exhaustion\nImplement disk I/O limits\n\n\nMonitor resource usage:\n\nTrack memory utilization\nMonitor CPU usage\nAlert on resource threshold violations\n\n\n\nAccess Control\n\nImplement least privilege access:\n\nCreate dedicated service accounts\nRestrict file system permissions\nUse SELinux or AppArmor profiles\n\n\n\nDisaster Recovery\n\nDocument recovery procedures:\n\nClear steps for various failure scenarios\nRegular testing of recovery procedures\nMaintain updated recovery documentation\n\n\nConfigure backup systems:\n\nRegular backup testing\nSecure offsite storage\nAutomated recovery validation\n\n\n\nContainer-Specific Hardening\nWhen deploying SPIKE Nexus in containers:\n\nUse minimal base images:\n\nBuild from scratch or distroless images\n\nRegular security updates\n\n\n\n\nConfigure container security:\n\nEnable seccomp profiles\nSet appropriate ulimits\nImplement container isolation\n\n\n\nRemember to regularly review and update these security measures based on new\nthreats and security best practices. Security configuration should be treated\nas a continuous process rather than a one-time setup.\nConclusion\nAlthough SPIKE is designed security best-practices in mind, a multi-layer\napproach focusing on system, process, and network security is important when\nconfiguring SPIKE for production.\nThe combination of mTLS API protection, SPIFFE attestation, and proper\nsystem-level security controls will provide robust protection against\nunauthorized access to sensitive cryptographic material.\nRemember that security is an ongoing process, and every system’s security\nposture and requirements is different. Thus, these measures outlined in this\nguide shall be taken as starting recommendations and adjusted to meet your\norganization’s security requirements.\n\n\nSPIKE Cross-Platform Build\nSPIKE Production Setup\nSPIKE Recovery Procedures\nSPIKE Release Management\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nCommunity\nSPIKE Architecture\nOperations\nTracking\n\n","id":"https://spike.ist/operations/production/","title":"SPIKE Production Setup"},"https://spike.ist/operations/recovery/":{"body":"SPIKE Recovery Procedures\nSPIKE ensures that your secrets are secure and resilient, aiming for seamless\noperations even in the most challenging situations.
