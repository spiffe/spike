## Secure Production Identity for Key Encryption (SPIKE)

**SPIKE** is a lightweight secrets store that uses [SPIFFE][spiffe]
as its identity control plane.

**SPIKE** protects your secrets and helps your ops, SREs, and sysadmins
`#sleepmore`.

For more information, [see the documentation][docs].

## The Elevator Pitch

[**SPIKE**][spike] is a streamlined, highly reliable secrets store that leverages 
[SPIFFE][spiffe] framework for strong, production-grade identity control. 

Built with simplicity and high availability in mind, SPIKE empowers ops teams, 
SREs, and sysadmins to protect sensitive data and `#sleepmore` by securing 
secrets across distributed environments.

Key components include:

* **SPIKE Nexus**: The heart of SPIKE, handling secret encryption, decryption, 
  and root key management.
* **SPIKE Keeper**: A redundancy mechanism that safely holds root keys in memory, 
  enabling fast recovery if Nexus fails.
* **SPIKE Pilot**: A secure CLI interface, translating commands into **mTLS** 
  API calls, reducing system vulnerability by containing all admin access.
* **SPIKE Bootstrap**: An initialization app to securely bootstrap the entire
  system and deliver root key shards to **SPIKE Nexus**.

With its minimal footprint and robust security, **SPIKE** provides peace of mind 
for your team and critical data resilience when it counts.

## Project Maturity: Development  ![Development Phase](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/.img/maturity/dev.svg)

**SPIKE** is a SPIFFE-affiliated project that has reached **Development** 
maturity as defined in the [SPIFFE Project Lifecycle][lifecycle]. This means:

* **SPIKE** is functionally stable and suitable for broader experimentation and
  community involvement.
* **SPIKE** is not yet production-ready, and certain features or interfaces may
  continue to evolve.
* Stability and polish are improving, but users should expect occasional bugs or
  breaking changes.

We invite developers and early adopters to explore, test, and contribute. Your
input is invaluable in helping us shape a robust and reliable product.

Use in critical systems is not advised at this time.
We'll announce when the project is ready for production adoption.
