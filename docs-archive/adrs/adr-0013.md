## Context

SPIKE needs a reliable, secure, and performant backing store to maintain encrypted 
data including:
- Root keys (*encrypted with admin password*)
- Admin tokens (*encrypted with root key*)
- Secrets (*encrypted with root key*)

The system requires:
- Secure storage of encrypted blobs
- Path-based access control
- Audit logging capabilities
- Flexible deployment options (*cloud and on-premises*)
- Integration with existing identity providers

After further analysis, we recognized that our secrets storage model closely 
resembles object storage patterns, where:
- Secrets are essentially encrypted blobs
- Access is path-based
- Authorization decisions are made at the path level
- Storage and retrieval operations are simple CRUD operations

## Decision

We will use S3-compatible storage systems (*AWS S3, MinIO*) as the backing 
store for SPIKE, leveraging their native policy engines for access control.

## Rationale

### Authorization Model
- S3's IAM/policy engine is battle-tested and well-understood
- Path-based policies align perfectly with SPIKE's access patterns
- Eliminates need to build and maintain a custom policy framework
- Policies can be managed through existing tools and processes

### Storage Capabilities
- Excellent for blob storage (*our encrypted secrets*)
- Strong consistency guarantees (*especially with newer S3 versions*)
- Built-in versioning support
- Cross-region replication options
- Excellent scalability characteristics

### Operational Benefits
- Multiple implementation options:
  - AWS S3 for cloud deployments
  - MinIO for on-premises deployments
  - Other S3-compatible systems for special cases
- Rich ecosystem of tools and utilities
- Robust backup and lifecycle management
- Built-in metrics and monitoring
- Cost-effective for our access patterns

### Security Features
- Native encryption at rest
- SSL/TLS support
- Integration with various identity providers
- Built-in audit logging
- Object versioning for recovery

## Consequences

### Positive
- Simplified architecture by using storage system's native policy engine
- Reduced code complexity in SPIKE
- Better separation of concerns (*storage/policy vs. application logic*)
- Flexibility in deployment options (*cloud or on-prem*)
- Future-proof: Can adopt better policy engines (*e.g., OPA*) without changing 
  storage layer
- Built-in versioning and audit capabilities

### Negative
- Dependent on S3 API compatibility
- May need to implement additional caching layer for performance
- Limited by S3's eventual consistency model for some operations
- Need to ensure policy engine capabilities are consistent across different 
  S3 implementations

### Mitigations
- Implement abstraction layer to handle S3 implementation differences
- Document consistency requirements and guarantees
- Regular testing with different S3-compatible systems

## Implementation Notes

### Storage Pattern
* Memory is the **primary** storage medium
* S3 serves dual purposes:
  * Authorization source (*via IAM/policies*)
  * Persistent backup store
* Write pattern:
  * Check S3 policy authorization
  * If authorized, write to memory
  * Asynchronously write to S3 for persistence
* Read pattern:
  * Check S3 policy authorization
  * If authorized, serve from memory
  * Only read from S3 during cold starts or recovery 
    * for non-HA deployments
    * for HA deployments, the design will need to be adjusted
* Delete pattern:
  * Check S3 policy authorization
  * If authorized, remove from memory
  * Mark as deleted in S3 (using versioning)

### Storage Layer
- Use AWS SDK for S3 operations
- Implement storage interface that can work with any S3-compatible system
- Encrypt all data before storage
- Use versioning for secret history

### Caching Strategy
- Implement in-memory cache for performance
- Cache only after confirming S3 permissions
- Clear cache on policy changes
- Implement TTL for cached items

### Policy Management
- Use native S3 policy format
- Document common policy patterns
- Provide helper utilities for policy creation
- Test policies across different S3 implementations

### Future Considerations
- If more complex policy requirements emerge, we can:
  1. Continue using S3 for storage
  2. Integrate OPA or similar for advanced policy evaluation
  3. Keep existing S3 policies as coarse-grained control

## Notes

This approach keeps SPIKE lean and focused while leveraging battle-tested 
components for storage and authorization. By using S3's native policy engine 
initially, we avoid premature optimization while maintaining the flexibility to 
adopt more sophisticated policy engines like OPA if needed in the future.
