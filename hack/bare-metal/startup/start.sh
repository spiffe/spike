# This is a helper script that establishes the following tasks:
#
# 0. Build the binaries for the demo app, SPIKE Keeper, and SPIKE Nexus.
# 1. Start the SPIRE server as a background process.
# 2. Generate an agent token.
# 3. Establish trust between the SPIRE server and SPIRE agent.
# 4. Start the SPIRE agent as a background process.
# 5. Register the SPIRE entries for SPIKE Keeper and SPIKE Nexus.
# 6. Start the SPIKE Keeper as a background process.
# 7. Start the SPIKE Nexus as a background process.
#
# The script also sets up a trap to ensure that all background processes are
# terminated when the script exits.
#
# Environment variables for skipping startup steps:
# - SPIKE_SKIP_CLEAR_DATA: Skip clearing existing data
# - SPIKE_SKIP_SPIKE_BUILD: Skip building SPIKE binaries
# - SPIKE_SKIP_SPIRE_SERVER_START: Skip starting SPIRE server
# - SPIKE_SKIP_GENERATE_AGENT_TOKEN: Skip generating SPIRE agent token
# - SPIKE_SKIP_REGISTER_ENTRIES: Skip registering SPIRE entries
# - SPIKE_SKIP_SPIRE_AGENT_START: Skip starting SPIRE agent
# - SPIKE_SKIP_KEEPER_INITIALIZATION: Skip initializing SPIKE Keeper instances
# - SPIKE_SKIP_NEXUS_START: Skip starting SPIKE Nexus
#
# Additional environment variables:
# - SPIKE_NEXUS_BACKEND_STORE: When set to "memory", skips Keeper instances
