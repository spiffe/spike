# `spike policy`

The `spike policy` command is the main entry point for managing **access
policies** in SPIKE. It allows administrators to define, view, and manage rules
that control access to secrets and resources based on workload identity 
(**SPIFFE ID**) and resource paths.

SPIKE provides two commands for managing policies:

1. **`spike policy create`**---Traditional command-line interface 
  (*backward compatibility*)
2. **`spike policy apply`**---Enhanced command with YAML file support 
  (*recommended for new workflows*)

While `spike policy create` checks for the existence of a policy, and
errors out if we are overriding an existing policy, `spike policy apply` uses
**upsert semantics**---it will create a new policy if one doesn't exist, or 
update an existing policy if one with the same name already exists. This makes 
the `spike policy apply` command safe to use in automation and GitOps workflows.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Using YAML file (recommended)
spike policy apply --file policy.yaml
```

## YAML File Format

### Basic Structure
```yaml
# Policy name - must be unique within the system
name: "web-service-policy"

# SPIFFE ID pattern for workload matching
spiffeid: "spiffe://example.org/web-service/"

# Path pattern for access control
# Note: Trailing slashes are automatically removed during normalization
path: "secrets/web-service/database"

# List of permissions to grant
permissions:
  - read
  - write
```

### Path Normalization

The `apply` command automatically normalizes paths by removing trailing slashes:

```yaml
# These paths are all normalized to the same value:
path: "secrets/database/production"    # ✓ Normalized form
path: "secrets/database/production/"   # → "secrets/database/production"
path: "secrets/database/production//"  # → "secrets/database/production"
```

### Realistic Path Examples

```yaml
# Database secrets
name: "database-policy"
spiffeid: "spiffe://example.org/database/"
path: "secrets/database/production"
permissions: [read]

# Web service configuration
name: "web-service-policy"
spiffeid: "spiffe://example.org/web-service/"
path: "secrets/web-service/config"
permissions: [read, write]

# Cache credentials
name: "cache-policy"
spiffeid: "spiffe://example.org/cache/"
path: "secrets/cache/redis/session"
permissions: [read]

# Application environment variables
name: "app-env-policy"
spiffeid: "spiffe://example.org/app/"
path: "secrets/app/env/production"
permissions: [read, list]
```

### All Available Permissions
```yaml
name: "admin-policy"
spiffeid: "spiffe://example.org/admin/"
path: "secrets"
permissions:
  - read    # Permission to read secrets
  - write   # Permission to create, update, or delete secrets
  - list    # Permission to list resources
  - super   # Administrative permissions
```

### Alternative YAML Formats

#### Flow Sequence for Permissions
```yaml
name: "database-policy"
spiffeid: "spiffe://example.org/database/"
path: "secrets/database/production"
permissions: [read, write, list]
```

#### Quoted Values
```yaml
name: "cache-policy"
spiffeid: "spiffe://example.org/cache/"
path: "secrets/cache/redis"
permissions:
  - "read"
  - "write"
```

## Creating Policies Using Command-Line Flags

Instead of using a `yaml` file, you can provide command-line arguments
to programmatically create your policies too:

```bash
# Create your first policy
spike policy create --name=my-service \
  --path="secrets/app/" \
  --spiffeid="spiffe://example.org/service/" \
  --permissions=read

# Verify your policy was created
spike policy list
```

## What are SPIKE Policies?

Policies in **SPIKE** provide a secure and flexible way to control access to 
secrets and resources. Each policy defines:

* **Who** can access resources (via **SPIFFE ID** patterns)
* **What** resources can be accessed (via **path** patterns)
* **How** resources can be accessed (via **permissions**)

Policies are the cornerstone of **SPIKE**'s security model, allowing for 
fine-grained access control based on workload identity. Using 
[**SPIFFE ID**][spiffe-concepts]s as the foundation, **SPIKE** ensures that 
only authorized workloads can access sensitive information.

[spiffe-concepts]: https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spiffe-about/spiffe-concepts/ "SPIFFE Concepts"

### How Policies Work

When a workload attempts to access a resource in SPIKE:

1. The workload presents its **SPIFFE ID** through a 
   SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document (**SVID**)
2. **SPIKE** validates the **SVID** to verify the workload's identity
3. **SPIKE** checks if any policy matches both:
   * The workload's **SPIFFE ID** against the policy's **SPIFFE ID pattern**
   * The requested **resource path** against the policy's **path pattern**
4. If a match is found, SPIKE checks if the requested operation is allowed by 
   the policy's **permissions**
5. Access is granted only if **ALL** conditions are met

### Why Use Policies?

* **Zero Trust Security**: Access is based on workload identity, not network 
  location
* **Least Privilege**: Grant only the permissions needed for each workload
* **Auditability**: All access is tied to specific policies and identities
* **Flexibility**: Patterns support regular expression matching, which allows
  a more fine-grained control over which resources the policy applies to.
* **Scalability**: Policies work consistently across any deployment size

## Features

* **Create policies** with specific permissions and access patterns
* **Apply policies** using upsert semantics (create new or update existing)
* **List all policies** in human-readable or JSON format
* **Get policy details** by ID or name
* **Delete policies** with confirmation protection
* **Enhanced validation** for permissions and parameters

## Commands

### `spike policy list`

```bash
spike policy list [--format=human|json] [--path=<pattern> | --spiffeid=<pattern>]
```

Lists all policies in the system. Can be filtered by a resource path pattern or 
a SPIFFE ID pattern.

**Note:** `--path` and `--spiffeid` flags cannot be used together.

### `spike policy create`

```bash
spike policy create --name=<name> \
  --path=<path-pattern> \
  --spiffeid=<spiffe-id-pattern> \
  --permissions=<permissions>
```
Creates a new policy with the specified parameters.

### `spike policy apply`

```bash
spike policy apply --file=<policy-file.yaml>
```

Creates a new policy with file-based input using YAML configuration.

#### YAML Configuration Format

When using the `--file` flag, the YAML file should follow this structure:

```yaml
name: policy-name
spiffeid: spiffe://example.org/service/
path: secrets/database/production
permissions:
  - read
  - write
```

### Example Files

SPIKE repository has the following example policies for your convenience:

* [`./examples/policies/sample-policy.yaml`][policy-example]---Basic policy example
* [`./examples/policies/test-policies/basic-policy.yaml`][basic-policy]---Minimal 
  policy
* [`./examples/policies/test-policies/admin-policy.yaml`][admin-policy]---Full 
  permissions policy
* [`./examples/policies/test-policies/invalid-permissions.yaml`][invalid-perms]---Example 
  with invalid permissions (for testing)

[policy-example]: https://github.com/spiffe/spike/blob/main/examples/policies/sample-policy.yaml
[basic-policy]: https://github.com/spiffe/spike/blob/main/examples/policies/test-policies/basic-policy.yaml
[admin-policy]: https://github.com/spiffe/spike/blob/main/examples/policies/test-policies/admin-policy.yaml
[invalid-perms]: https://github.com/spiffe/spike/blob/main/examples/policies/test-policies/invalid-permissions.yaml

#### Permission Types

| Permission | Description                                            |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **read**   | Allows reading secrets and resources                   |
| **write**  | Allows creating, updating, and deleting secrets        |
| **list**   | Allows listing resources and directories               |
| **super**  | Full administrative permissions (**use with caution**) |

#### Validation

All policy configurations are validated to ensure:

1. **Required fields**: `name`, `spiffeid`, `path`, and `permissions` must be 
   present
2. **Valid permissions**: Only `read`, `write`, `list`, and `super` are allowed
3. **Valid YAML syntax**: Proper YAML formatting is required (for YAML files)
4. **Non-empty values**: All fields must have non-empty values

#### GitOps Integration

YAML files can be easily integrated into GitOps workflows:

1. **Store policy YAML files in a Git repository**
   ```txt
   policies/
   ├── web-service-policy.yaml
   ├── database-policy.yaml
   └── admin-policy.yaml
   ```

2. **Use CI/CD pipelines to validate policies before deployment**
   ```bash
   # Validation step in CI
   for policy in policies/*.yaml; do
     spike policy apply --file "$policy"
     # - ensure that the policy is created
     # - delete the policy
     # - ensure that the policy is gone
   done
   ```

3. **Apply policies using `spike policy apply --file` in deployment scripts**
   ```bash
   # Deployment script
   for policy in policies/*.yaml; do
     spike policy apply --file "$policy"
   done
   ```
4. **Version control changes to policies alongside application code**

5. **Use upsert semantics to safely apply policy changes without worrying 
   about conflicts**

### `spike policy get`

```bash
spike policy get <id> [--format=human|json]
spike policy get --name=<name> [--format=human|json]
```

Gets details of a specific policy by ID or name. Use `--format=json` 
for machine-readable output.

### `spike policy delete`

```bash
spike policy delete <id>
spike policy delete --name=<name>
```

Deletes a policy by ID or name. Requires confirmation.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Create a policy for a web service with read and write access
spike policy create \
  --name=web-service \
  --path="secrets/web/" \
  --spiffeid="spiffe://example.org/web/" \
  --permissions=read,write

# Create a policy with multiple permissions
spike policy create \
  --name=admin-service \
  --path="secrets/" \
  --spiffeid="spiffe://example.org/admin/" \
  --permissions=read,write,list

# Apply a policy using a YAML file
spike policy apply --file=policy.yaml

# List all policies in JSON format (useful for automation)
spike policy list --format=json

# Get details of a specific policy by name
spike policy get --name=web-service

# Get policy details in JSON format
spike policy get --name=web-service --format=json

# Delete a policy and confirm deletion
spike policy delete --name=web-service
```

## Pattern Syntax

**SPIKE** policies support **regular expression** pattern matching for both 
SPIFFE IDs and resource paths:

- If the pattern is a single `"*"`, then it matches anything.
- For any other pattern, the pattern is compiled as a "*regular expression*".

This would mean, for an exact match, you would need to include `^` and `$` in
your patterns as well.

For example:

* `secrets/db` matches `global/secrets/db` and `secrets/db/local`
* Whereas, `^secrets/db$` only matches `secrets/db` and nothing else 
  (*`global/secrets/db` and `secrets/db/local` will not match*)

Thus, for precise control, you might want to include `^` and `$` at the 
beginning and end of your patterns respectively for an exact match.

## How Regular Expressions are Used For Policy Matching

More specifically, **SPIKE** compiles **SPIFFE ID patterns** and 
**path patterns** defined in the policies into **regular
expressions**. 

Here is a simplified version of how this regular expression compilation
happens behind-the-scenes:

```go
pathRegex, err := regexp.Compile(policy.PathPattern)
// ... error handling omitted for brevity.
policy.PathRegex = pathRegex
// `pathRegEx` is used for policy validation.
```

As seen from the example above, both the path pattern and the SPIFFE ID
pattern that are provided during policy creation which are used "**AS IS**" to 
create regular expression matchers. These patterns are compiled
into Go's built-in regex engine, ensuring that the matching process strictly
adheres to the patterns defined in the policy, allowing for precise and flexible
access control.

## Simplicity Is the Key

Because of the regular expression usage in SPIKE policies, a `policy create` 
operation can define more flexible matching patterns. However, keeping patterns 
simple is both more secure and easier to manage and reason about. Creating a 
pattern that is too broad or that uses overly complex regular expressions may 
lead to unintended consequences and security risks. **Simplicity** is important 
to ensure patterns are clear, predictable, and effective.

When a workload attempts to access a resource, its **SPIFFE ID** and the 
requested resource **path** are matched against these compiled **regular
expressions**. This ensures that both identity and resource patterns follow the
specified rules and allow for flexibility with wildcards or exact matches.

### Path Pattern Examples

```txt
secrets/               # All resources in the secrets directory
secrets/database/      # Only resources in the database subdirectory  
secrets/database/creds # Only the specific creds resource

# You can provide regular expressions for a more fine-tuned
# pattern match:
^secrets/db-[123]$ # Matches secrets/db-2, but not secrets/db-4.
```

## Path Patterns in SPIKE

Path patterns in **SPIKE** are designed to provide flexibility but also follow
certain conventions for clarity and usability. While the path pattern is
suggested (*but not mandated*) to look like a UNIX-style path for familiarity, 
**SPIKE secret paths DO NOT start with a leading slash**.

This is because **SPIKE paths represent logical key namespaces**, not
hierarchical filesystem paths. They are always relative to the secrets engine
mount point, making the leading slash redundant and potentially confusing.

#### Example:

* **Correct:** `secrets/app/config`
* **Redundant/Confusing:** `/secrets/app/config`

Additionally, although there is currently no restriction on how the path is
formed, it is worth noting that future versions of **SPIKE** may restrict paths 
from having a trailing slash to avoid ambiguity and maintain consistency
in naming practices.

#### Best Practices for Path Patterns:

1. Avoid leading slashes.
2. Avoid trailing slashes to ensure forward compatibility.
3. Use descriptive and meaningful names that reflect the resource's purpose or
   hierarchy.

### SPIFFE ID Pattern Examples
```
spiffe://example.org/              # Workloads in the example.org trust domain
spiffe://example.org/web/          # Only web workloads
^spiffe://example.org/web/server$  # Only the specific web server workload
```

## Best Practices

* Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions
* Use descriptive policy names that reflect their purpose
* Create separate policies for different workload types
* Use specific path patterns rather than overly broad ones
* Regularly audit and review your policies
* Never assign `super` permissions unless absolutely necessary
