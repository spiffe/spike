# Building SPIKE Locally and Deploying to Minikube

If you want to contribute to the **SPIKE** codebase and test your changes on a 
local Kubernetes cluster, follow this guide. If you want to build SPIKE from
the source code but want to test it on a *bare metal* Linux machine without 
using any containerization solution, check out 
[**SPIKE** on Linux][spike-on-linux] instead.

In this guide we will follow a similar approach to 
[**SPIKE** Quickstart][quickstart], with the following changes:

1. Build container images locally from existing source code.
2. Push the container images to a local container registry. 
3. Use a customized `values-dev.yaml` for the helm charts to create a more
   production-like namespace structure.

[spike-on-linux]: @/development/bare-metal.md "SPIKE on Linux"
[quickstart]: @/getting-started/quickstart.md "Getting Started with SPIKE"

Without further ado, let's begin with the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Here is a list of things you need to have installed on your machine before
starting with this guide:

* Have [Docker][docker] installed and running on your machine.
* Have a [`kubectl`][kubectl] client installed.
* Have [`make`][make] installed on your machine.
* Have a [`minikube`][minikube] binary installed.
* Have [`helm`][helm] binary installed.

[docker]: https://www.docker.com/ "Docker: Build, Share, and Run Applications"
[kubectl]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/ "kubectl: Kubernetes command-line tool"
[make]: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/ "GNU Make: Build Automation Tool"
[helm]: https://helm.sh/ "Helm"
[minikube]: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/ "Minikube: Run Kubernetes Locally"

## Docker Registry Setup

For security, SPIKE components lock the memory they use at runtime. You may
need to update the `ulimit` settings for your Docker daemon to allow this.

For Linux, edit or create the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file and add the
following:

```json
{
  "default-ulimits": {
    "memlock": {
      "Name": "memlock",
      "Hard": 17179869184,
      "Soft": 17179869184
    }
  }
}
```

`17179869184` will set the maximum amount of memory a container can lock to 
16GB. You can set this to a lower value if you want, since SPIKE components 
don't need that much memory.

For Docker for Mac, or Docker for Windows, you will need to update
the Docker Engine settings from the "*Settings > Docker Engine*" menu as
follows:

```json
{
  "builder": {
    "gc": {
      "defaultKeepStorage": "20GB",
      "enabled": true
    }
  },
  "experimental": false,
  "default-ulimits": {
    "memlock": {
      "Name": "memlock",
      "Hard": 17179869184,
      "Soft": 17179869184
    }
  }
}
```

Once the change is done, remember to restart the Docker Engine.

## All-in-One Script

If you have the prerequisites set up and want to skip ahead and run the entire 
guide in one go, you can use the following script:

```bash
cd $WORKSPACE # Replace with your workspace directory
git clone https://github.com/spiffe/spike.git
cd spike
make deploy-minikube 
```

## Starting Minikube

To start a local Minikube cluster, clone the project repository and run the
following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
cd $WORKSPACE # Replace with your workspace directory
git clone https://github.com/spiffe/spike.git
cd spike
make docker-cleanup # (Optional) Purge docker registry.
make k8s-delete     # Delete any former Minikube installation.
make k8s-start      # This will start a Minikube cluster.
```

If successful, you will have a local Minikube cluster running with the
necessary plugins enabled. You can verify that Minikube is running by executing:

```bash
minikube status
# or...
kubectl get node

# Sample Outputs:
#
# $ minikube status
# minikube
# type: Control Plane
# host: Running
# kubelet: Running
# apiserver: Running
# kubeconfig: Configured
#
# $ kubectl get node
# NAME       STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
# minikube   Ready    control-plane   67s   v1.33.1
```

## Build Container Images Locally

We have a `make` target to build the container images locally.

```bash
make docker-build
```

## Pushing Container Images to the Local Registry

Next up, we'll push the container images to our internal Minikube container
registry:

```bash
make k8s-load-images
```





That said, `make k8s-load-images` is the safest and simplest way to push
the images into Minikube without having to deal with Docker networking,
port forwarding, and Docker registry, making it the preferred method, and
it is what we recommend.

## Deploying SPIRE and SPIKE to the Local Cluster

Once we push the container images to the registry, we can now deploy **SPIRE**
and **SPIKE**.

```bash
# Uses `./config/helm/values-local.yaml`
make deploy-dev-local
```

## Verifying SPIKE Deployment

First, make sure that your components are up and running.

The following commands should **all** show `Ready` and `Runing` containers.

```bash
kubectl get po -n spire-server
# spiffe-server-0
# spiffe-spiffe-oidc-discovery-provider
kubectl get po -n spire-system
# spiffe-agent
# spiffe-spiffe-csi-driver
kubectl get po -n spike
# spiffe-spike-keeper-0
# spiffe-spike-keeper-1
# spiffe-spike-keeper-2
# spiffe-spike-nexus-0
# spiffe-spike-pilot
```

You can also shell into **SPIKE Pilot** to create and retrieve secrets to 
ensure **SPIKE** is up and running and properly configured in the cluster.

```bash
make exec-spike
# ^ This will shell into SPIKE Pilot.
# Now you can execute the following commands:
spike secret list
# Output:
# No Secrets found.
spike secret put test/creds username=spike password=SPIKERocks
# Output:
# OK
spike secret list
# Output:
# - test/creds
spike secret get test/creds
# Output:
# password: SPIKERocks
# username: spike

```

## You Are All Set

That's it. Now, you know how to modify **SPIKE**'s source code and test your
changes in a local Kubernetes cluster.

Next up, you might want to [Read **SPIKE**'s Source Code][github] to learn more
about **SPIKE**'s internals, or [learn more about **SPIKE**'s 
architecture][architecture] or [security model][security-model].

You might also want to try [building **SPIKE** on a bare metal 
Linux][bare-metal] if you want to see how **SPIKE** can be used on a bare
metal Linux machine without using container orchestration such as *Kubernetes*
