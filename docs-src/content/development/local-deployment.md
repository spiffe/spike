# Building SPIKE Locally and Deploying to Minikube

If you want to contribute to the **SPIKE** codebase and test your changes on a 
local Kubernetes cluster, follow this guide. If you want to build SPIKE from
the source code but want to test it on a *bare metal* Linux machine without 
using any containerization solution, check out 
[**SPIKE** on Linux][spike-on-linux] instead.

In this guide we will follow a similar approach to 
[**SPIKE** Quickstart][quickstart], with the following changes:

1. Build container images locally from existing source code.
2. Push the container images to a local container registry. 
3. Use a customized `values-dev.yaml` for the helm charts to create a more
   production-like namespace structure.

[spike-on-linux]: @/development/bare-metal.md "SPIKE on Linux"
[quickstart]: @/getting-started/quickstart.md "Getting Started with SPIKE"

Without further ado, let's begin with the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Here is a list of things you need to have installed on your machine before
starting with this guide:

* Have [Docker][docker] installed and running on your machine.
* Have a [`kubectl`][kubectl] client installed.
* Have [`make`][make] installed on your machine.
* Have a [`minikube`][minikube] binary installed.
* Have [`helm`][helm] binary installed.

[docker]: https://www.docker.com/ "Docker: Build, Share, and Run Applications"
[kubectl]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/ "kubectl: Kubernetes command-line tool"
[make]: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/ "GNU Make: Build Automation Tool"
[helm]: https://helm.sh/ "Helm"

## Starting Minikube

To start a local Minikube cluster, clone the project repository and run the
following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
cd $WORKSPACE # Replace with your workspace directory
git clone https://github.com/spiffe/spike.git
cd spike
make docker-cleanup # (Optional) Purge docker registry.
make k8s-delete     # Delete any former Minikube installation.
make k8s-start      # This will start a Minikube cluster.
```

If successful, you will have a local Minikube cluster running with the
necessary plugins enabled. You can verify that Minikube is running by executing:

```bash
minikube status
# or...
kubectl get node

# Sample Outputs:
#
# $ minikube status
# minikube
# type: Control Plane
# host: Running
# kubelet: Running
# apiserver: Running
# kubeconfig: Configured
#
# $ kubectl get node
# NAME       STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
# minikube   Ready    control-plane   67s   v1.33.1
```

## Forwarding the Local Registry

Since Minikube contains its Kubernetes cluster in a virtual machine, accessing
its container registry requires network mapping. There are several ways to 
achieve this. In this guide, we will use Kubernetes port forwarding.

Open a terminal, change your directory to the project's folder, and execute
the following:

```bash 
make docker-forward-registry
# Sample Output:
# Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:5000 -> 5000
# Forwarding from [::1]:5000 -> 5000
```

Leave this terminal open. We will execute the rest of the commands in  
a separate terminal window.

> **Alternative to Registry Port Forwarding**
>
> If you don't want to use port forwarding, you can directly load the container
> images into the Minikube cluster's local registry.
>
> Although this is typically used to overcome network restrictions around
> WSL and Docker for Windows, it can also be used as an alternative to port
> forwarding.
>
> To copy images directly into the Minikube cluster's local registry, do not run
> the above command, but instead execute the following:
>
> ```bash
> make k8s-load-images
> ```
>
> This will effectively have the same end-result as port forwarding, and you
> won't have to keep the port forwarding terminal open.

## Build Container Images Locally

We have a `make` target to build the container images locally.

```bash
make docker-build
```

## Pushing Container Images to the Local Registry

Next up, we'll push the container images to our internal Minikube container
registry:

```bash
# Make sure you port forward using 
# `make docker-forward-registry`
# before executing this command:
make docker-push
```

## Docker Windows Subsystem for Linux Integration Issues

If `make docker-push` hangs up or gives a network error, it's typically
related to how Docker for Windows, Windows, and Windows Subsystem for Linux
handle routing, DNS resolution, and networking.
 
One way to push container images to the Minikube cluster without adding them
to the local Minikube registry would be to run the following script:

```bash
make k8s-load-images
```

This will effectively have the same end-result as pushing the images to
the registry.

Alternatively, you might try pointing your terminal's Docker CLI to the 
Docker engine inside Minikube:

```bash
# Set Minikube Docker environment
eval $(minikube docker-env)
# Interact with Minikube's Docker Engine
make docker-build
# Unset Minikube Docker environment when you're done
eval $(minikube docker-env --unset)
```

For Mac OS and Linuxes, where if you get registry-access-related errors, adding
the following to `/etc/docker/daemon.json` can help:

```json
{
  "insecure-registries": ["localhost:5000"]
}
```

For Docker for Mac, or Docker for Windows, you will need to update
the Docker Engine settings from the "*Settings > Docker Engine*" menu as
follows:

```json
{
  "builder": {
    "gc": {
      "defaultKeepStorage": "20GB",
      "enabled": true
    }
  },
  "experimental": false,
  "insecure-registries": [
    "localhost:5000"
  ]
}
```

Once the change is done, don't forget to restart the Docker Engine.

That said, `make k8s-load-images` is the safest and simplest way to push
the images into Minikube without having to deal with Docker networking,
port forwarding, and Docker registry, making it the preferred method, and
it is what we recommend.

## Deploying SPIRE and SPIKE to the Local Cluster

Once we push the container images to the registry, we can now deploy **SPIRE**
and **SPIKE**.

```bash
# Uses `./config/helm/values-dev.yaml`
make deploy-dev-local
```

## Verifying SPIKE Deployment

First, make sure that your components are up and running.

The following commands should **all** show `Ready` and `Runing` containers.

```bash
kubectl get po -n spire-server
# spiffe-server-0
# spiffe-spiffe-oidc-discovery-provider
kubectl get po -n spire-system
# spiffe-agent
# spiffe-spiffe-csi-driver
kubectl get po -n spike
# spiffe-spike-keeper-0
# spiffe-spike-keeper-1
# spiffe-spike-keeper-2
# spiffe-spike-nexus-0
# spiffe-spike-pilot
```

You can also shell into **SPIKE Pilot** to create and retrieve secrets to 
ensure **SPIKE** is up and running and properly configured in the cluster.

```bash
make exec-spike
# ^ This will shell into SPIKE Pilot.
# Now you can execute the following commands:
spike secret list
# Output:
# No Secrets found.
spike secret put test/creds username=spike password=SPIKERocks
# Output:
# OK
spike secret list
# Output:
# - test/creds
spike secret get test/creds
# Output:
# password: SPIKERocks
# username: spike

```

## You Are All Set

That's it. Now, you know how to modify **SPIKE**'s source code and test your
changes in a local Kubernetes cluster.

Next up, you might want to [Read **SPIKE**'s Source Code][github] to learn more
about **SPIKE**'s internals, or [learn more about **SPIKE**'s 
architecture][architecture] or [security model][security-model].

You might also want to try [building **SPIKE** on a bare metal 
Linux][bare-metal] if you want to see how **SPIKE** can be used on a bare
metal Linux machine without using container orchestration such as *Kubernetes*
