# SPIKE Architectural Decision Records (*ADRs*)

This section serves as an archive of significant architectural decisions made
during the design and development of **SPIKE**. Each **ADR* documents the 
reasoning behind a specific choice, along with the associated alternatives 
and their trade-offs. By maintaining this record, we provide transparency, 
traceability, and clarity for current and future maintainers of the **SPIKE** 
project.

Below, you will find the list of ADRs organized for easy access. Click on each
entry to read more details.
