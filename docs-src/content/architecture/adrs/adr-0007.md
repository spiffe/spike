# ADR-0007: Root Key Lifecycle and Management Strategy

<br style="clear:both" />

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2024-11-03
- Tags: Security

## Context

Our system requires a robust and secure approach to managing the root key, 
which is fundamental to the entire security infrastructure. We need to 
establish:
* Key generation and storage policies
* Backup and recovery procedures
* Rotation policies
* Emergency recovery procedures

The root key is a critical security component that requires careful handling 
throughout its lifecycle while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Decision

We will implement the following key management strategy:

### Root Key Characteristics
* Long-lived key with periodic rotation
* Generated automatically by SPIKE Nexus
* Stored exclusively in memory, never on disk in plain text

### Key Protection
* Administrator-provided password through SPIKE Pilot
* Encrypted backup for emergency recovery
* Memory-only plain text existence

### Key Rotation:
* Periodic rotation schedule
* Automatic re-encryption of all dependent secrets
* Maintain system availability during rotation

## Consequences

### Positive
* No plain text key storage on disk
* Administrator-controlled recovery capability
* Automated key generation reduces human error
* Regular rotation enhances security
* Automatic re-encryption maintains data security
* Clear recovery procedures

### Negative
* Dependency on administrator password
* Risk of system unavailability if both memory content and recovery password are 
  lost
* Performance impact during key rotation and re-encryption
* Need for careful password management
* Operational complexity during rotation

## Implementation Requirements

### Key Generation

#### Initial Generation
* Automated generation by SPIKE Nexus
* Cryptographically secure random number generator
* Immediate memory storage

#### Storage Requirements:
* Memory-only plain text storage
* Secure memory handling
* Memory zeroing after use

### Backup and Recovery

#### Password Requirements
* Strong password policies
* Secure password transmission
* Password storage guidelines

#### Backup Process
* Encryption of the root key
* Secure storage of encrypted backup
* Regular backup verification

### Key Rotation

#### Rotation Process:
* Automated rotation procedure
* Gradual secret re-encryption
* Validation of re-encrypted secrets

#### Scheduling:
* Define rotation intervals
* Maintenance window planning
* Emergency rotation procedures

## Critical Operations

### Password Management

#### Administrator Responsibilities:
* Secure password creation
* Password storage
* Access control
* Regular password verification

#### Recovery Procedures:
* Emergency recovery process
* Password verification
* System restoration steps

### Rotation Operations

#### Pre-rotation:
* System health check
* Backup verification
* Resource availability check

#### During Rotation:
* Progress monitoring
* Error handling
* Recovery readiness

#### Post-rotation:
* Verification of re-encrypted secrets
* System health validation
* Backup update

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Key Health
* Memory presence verification
* Backup status
* Rotation schedule tracking

### Critical Alerts:
* Failed rotation attempts
* Backup failures
* Memory issues
* Access attempts

## Recovery Procedures

### Emergency Recovery:
* Password validation
* Backup decryption
* System restoration
* Verification steps

### Failed Rotation Recovery:
* Rollback procedures
* System state verification
* Impact assessment

## Notes
* Regular audits of key management procedures are required
* Document all rotation events and issues
* Maintain detailed recovery runbooks
* Regular testing of recovery procedures
* Password management procedures must be documented and practiced

## Warning

The administrator password for key recovery is **CRUCIAL**. Loss of this 
password combined with system failure could result in permanent data loss. 
Implement appropriate password management procedures.
