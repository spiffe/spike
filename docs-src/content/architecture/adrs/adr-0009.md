# ADR-0009: Multi-Administrator Support System

<br style="clear:both" />

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2024-11-03
- Tags: Security, Administration, Disaster Recovery

## Context

The system needs to support multiple administrators with different levels of 
access and responsibilities. We need to:
* Allow delegation of administrative tasks
* Support different administrative roles
* Implement fine-grained access control
* Maintain audit trails
* Support tenant isolation
* Handle emergency access scenarios

## Decision

We will implement a hierarchical multi-admin system with policy-based access 
control:

### Administrative Hierarchy
* Initial admin has super-admin privileges
* Ability to create and manage other admin accounts
* Policy-based access control for different admin roles

### Access Control
* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* Tenant-based isolation
* Fine-grained permissions
* Temporary token-based authentication

## Consequences

### Positive
* Distributed administrative responsibilities
* Clear separation of duties
* Tenant data isolation
* Granular access control
* Improved audit capabilities
* Support for different administrative personas
* Reduced single-admin bottleneck
* Enhanced security through the principle of least privilege

### Negative
* Increased system complexity
* More complex policy management
* Additional overhead in user management
* Need for policy coordination
* Increased training requirements
* More complex authorization logic

## Implementation Requirements

### User Management

#### Admin Creation
* Username/password management
* Role assignment
* Policy association
* Tenant assignment

#### Authentication
* Individual login credentials
* Personal access tokens
* Token lifecycle management
* Session management

### Policy Management

#### Policy Definition
* Read/Write permissions
* Resource access levels
* Tenant boundaries
* Emergency access rights

#### Policy Enforcement
* Real-time permission checking
* Token validation
* Resource access control
* Tenant isolation

### Administrative Roles

#### Super Admin
* User management
* Policy creation
* System-wide access
* Emergency procedures

#### Tenant Admin:
* Tenant-specific access
* Resource management
* User management within tenant
* Limited policy modification

#### Auditor:
* Read-only access
* Audit log access
* Report generation
* Compliance monitoring

#### Emergency Admin:
* Break-glass procedures
* Temporary elevated access
* Emergency restoration capabilities

## Access Control Implementation

### RBAC Structure

#### Role Definitions

```yaml
roles:
 super_admin:
   - all_permissions
 tenant_admin:
   - tenant_read
   - tenant_write
   - tenant_user_manage
 auditor:
   - system_read
   - audit_read
```

#### Permission Mapping:

```yaml
permissions:
 tenant_read:
   - read_secrets
   - list_resources
 tenant_write:
   - create_secrets
   - update_secrets
   - delete_secrets
```

### Tenant Isolation

#### Resource Segregation
* Tenant-specific namespaces
* Resource ownership
* Access boundaries
* Cross-tenant protection

#### Access Patterns
* Tenant-specific tokens
* Scoped permissions
* Resource filtering
* Access validation

## Audit Requirements

### User Activity
* Login attempts
* Resource access
* Policy modifications
* User management actions

### Audit Trail:
* Timestamp
* User identity
* Action details
* Resource affected
* Access context

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Security Events:
* Policy violations
* Unauthorized access attempts
* Emergency access usage
* Cross-tenant access attempts

### Administrative Actions:
* User creation/modification
* Policy changes
* Permission updates
* Emergency procedures

## Emergency Procedures

### Access Elevation:
* Temporary privilege elevation
* Approval workflow
* Time-limited access
* Audit requirements

#### Break-Glass Procedures:
* Emergency access protocol
* Recovery procedures
* Audit requirements
* Post-incident review

## Notes
* Regular policy review is required
* Document all role definitions
* Maintain emergency access procedures
* Regular access audit recommended
* Train administrators on policy management

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Create clear role definitions
2. Implement strict tenant boundaries
3. Establish emergency procedures
4. Document all policies
5. Regular access reviews
6. Maintain audit logs
7. Test emergency procedures regularly
