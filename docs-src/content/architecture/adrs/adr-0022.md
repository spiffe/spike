# ADR-0022: Continuous Polling of SPIKE Keepers Despite 404 Responses

- Status: accepted

## Context

**SPIKE Nexus** distributes root encryption key shards to multiple 
**SPIKE Keeper** instances using **Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme**. 

When a **SPIKE Keeper** doesn't have a shard (e.g., after restart or during 
initial deployment), it returns a `404` HTTP response to shard retrieval 
requests from **SPIKE Nexus**.

A question has arisen about the appropriate behavior when **SPIKE Nexus** 
receives 404 responses from **SPIKE Keeper** instances:

1. Should **SPIKE Nexus** stop polling a **SPIKE Keeper** after receiving a 404 
   response?
2. Should **SPIKE Nexus** continue polling **SPIKE Keeper** instances regardless 
   of previous 404 responses?

This decision is particularly relevant in scenarios where:
* **SPIKE Keeper** instances may restart
* New **SPIKE Keeper** instances may be deployed
* **SPIKE Keeper** instances may be rehydrated through alternative methods
* The system architecture needs to support future recovery mechanisms

## Decision

**SPIKE Nexus will continue polling SPIKE Keepers even after receiving 404 
responses.**

Specifically:

1. **SPIKE Nexus** will maintain a regular polling schedule for all known 
   **SPIKE Keeper** instances, regardless of their response history.
2. A 404 response from a **SPIKE Keeper** will be logged but will not affect the 
   polling schedule.
3. **SPIKE Nexus** will **NOT** remove a **SPIKE Keeper** from its polling list 
   based solely on 404 responses.
4. **SPIKE Nexus** will automatically attempt to rehydrate empty 
   **SPIKE Keeper**s when possible.

## Rationale

The primary reasons for this decision are:

1. **Future Extensibility**: It allows for future mechanisms to rehydrate 
   **SPIKE Keepers** through alternative methods:
    - Other **SPIKE Nexus** instances may seed the **SPIKE Keeper**
    - Cloning from backup **SPIKE Keepers** may become available
    - Secure **SPIKE Keeper** APIs may be implemented that allow shard 
      restoration

2. **Architectural Simplicity**: Continuing to poll all **SPIKE Keeper**s 
   regardless of their state creates a simpler, more consistent architecture:
    - No complex logic to manage the polling schedule
    - No state to track which **SPIKE Keepers** should be excluded
    - Reduced risk of accidentally abandoning a recoverable **SPIKE Keeper**

3. **Operational Resilience**: Continuous polling allows the system to 
   automatically recover when conditions change:
    - **SPIKE Keepers** that restart will be discovered during the next polling 
      cycle
    - If a previously unavailable **SPIKE Keeper** comes back online with a 
      shard, it will be immediately useful
    - No manual intervention is required to re-enable polling

4. **Fewer Assumptions**: This approach makes fewer assumptions about the future 
   state of the system:
    - Does not assume a 404 response means permanent unavailability
    - Does not assume the current distribution methods are the only ones possible
    - Allows for unanticipated recovery scenarios

## Consequences

### Positive

- System can automatically recover from **SPIKE Keeper** restarts without manual 
  intervention
- Architecture remains simpler with fewer conditional paths and state tracking
- Future extensibility is preserved for new recovery mechanisms
- Consistent behavior across all **SPIKE Keeper** instances
- Reduced operational burden for managing the system

### Negative

* Slightly increased network traffic due to polling **SPIKE Keepers** that may 
  remain empty
* Potential resource usage for maintaining connections to **SPIKE Keepers** that 
  consistently return 404
* Additional log entries for expected 404 responses
* May mask actual problems if a **SPIKE Keeper** is consistently unavailable for
  other reasons

## Alternatives Considered

### Stop Polling After Consistent 404 Responses

- **Rejected** because it would require additional logic to track 
  **SPIKE Keeper** states
- Would introduce a permanent failure mode requiring manual intervention
- Would not automatically benefit from future recovery mechanisms
- Would add complexity to the codebase
- Would create an inconsistent behavior pattern depending on response history

### Event-Based Notification System

- **Rejected** in favor of simple polling, though may be reconsidered in the future
- Would require **SPIKE Keepers** to have knowledge of **SPIKE Nexus**, 
  violating the design principle
- More complex to implement and maintain
- Introduces potential reliability issues with missed notifications
- Would conflict with `ADR-0021`'s principle of **SPIKE Keeper** as a stateless
  shard holder

## Decision Outcome

This decision is implemented as the standard behavior for **SPIKE Nexus** when 
interacting with **SPIKE Keeper** instances. The continuous polling approach:

1. Aligns with the principle of simplicity in the SPIKE architecture
2. Maintains the stateless nature of **SPIKE Keepers** as defined in `ADR-0021`
3. Provides immediate recovery when **SPIKE Keepers** become available
4. Supports future extensibility for alternative recovery mechanisms

The system should be monitored for any performance impacts from continuous 
polling, but the architectural benefits outweigh the minimal resource costs 
associated with this approach.
