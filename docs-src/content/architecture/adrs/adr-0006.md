# ADR-0006: Trust Boundary Definition and Security Assumptions

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2024-11-03
- Tags: Security, Threat Model, Trust

## Context

We need to clearly define our system's trust boundaries and security assumptions 
to:
* Establish realistic security expectations
* Guide the efforts to harden security
* Define the scope of security measures
* Inform deployment strategies
* Guide incident response planning

The system includes multiple critical components (**SPIKE Nexus**, 
**SPIKE Keeper**, **SPIRE**) that handle sensitive data, particularly 
the **root key**.

## Decision
We will establish the following trust boundary model:

* Primary Trust Boundary:
  * Set at the machine/host level
  * Consider the machine as the primary security perimeter
  * Treat machine compromise as a complete system compromise

* Component Security Approach:
  * Implement defense-in-depth while acknowledging its limitations
  * Focus on container hardening for containerized deployments
  * Accept that component-level security provides diminishing returns after 
    machine compromise

## Consequences

### Positive
* Clear security expectations and boundaries
* Focused security efforts
* Realistic threat modeling
* Efficient resource allocation for security measures
* Clear incident response triggers
* Simplified security architecture

### Negative
* Accepting certain security limitations
* Dependency on host-level security
* Need for strong physical security measures
* Higher requirements for host hardening
* Increased importance of access control

## Security Implications

### Machine-Level Security

#### Critical Areas
* Physical security
* OS-level hardening
* Access control
* Host monitoring
* System integrity

#### Attack Vectors Accepted as Valid Threats
* Memory inspection/modification
* Process manipulation
* Workload injection
* SPIRE entry manipulation
* Root key exposure through memory access

### Component-Level Security

#### SPIKE Nexus
* Implement container hardening
* Minimize attack surface
* Monitor for anomalies
* Restrict capabilities

#### SPIKE Keeper
* Treat compromise as machine compromise
* Implement memory protection measures
* Restrict access and capabilities
* Monitor for unauthorized access

## Implementation Requirements

### Host Security

#### Physical Security:
* Secure data center access
* Hardware security modules where applicable
* Physical access logging
* Tamper detection

#### OS Security:
* Regular security updates
* Minimal running services
* Secure boot
* Kernel hardening
* Access control lists

### Container Security

#### Container Hardening:
* Minimal base images
* No privileged containers
* Resource limitations
* Read-only filesystems
* Security context constraints

#### Runtime Protection:
* Container scanning
* Runtime security monitoring
* Behavioral analysis
* Resource isolation

## Monitoring and Detection

#### Host-Level
* System integrity monitoring
* Privilege escalation detection
* Resource usage anomalies
* Access pattern analysis

#### Component-Level:
* Memory access patterns
* Process behavior
* API call patterns
* Resource utilization

## Incident Response Triggers
* Unauthorized physical access
* Anomalous system calls
* Unexpected memory access patterns
* SPIRE entry modifications
* Container escape attempts

## Notes

This ADR should be reviewed when:
* New deployment models are considered
* Significant architecture changes occur
* New security threats emerge
