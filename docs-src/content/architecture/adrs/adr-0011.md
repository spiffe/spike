# ADR-0011: PostgreSQL as SPIKE's Backing Store

<br style="clear:both" />

- Status:
   - Superseded by [ADR-0013: S3-Compatible Storage as SPIKE's Backing Store](@/architecture/adrs/adr-0013.md)
- Date: 2024-11-07

## Context

**SPIKE** needs a reliable, secure, and performant backing store to maintain 
various types of encrypted data, including:

* Root keys (*encrypted with admin password*)
* Admin tokens (*encrypted with root key*)
* Secrets (*encrypted with root key*)

The system requires:
1. Strong data consistency and ACID transactions
2. Support for binary data storage (for encrypted keys and secrets)
3. Advanced data types and indexing capabilities
4. Robust access control and security features
5. Audit logging capabilities
6. Schema management and version control

## Decision

We will use [PostgreSQL][postgres] as the exclusive backing store for **SPIKE**, 
with **SPIKE Nexus** being the **only** client with direct database access.

[postgres]: https://www.postgresql.org/

### Rationale

#### **Security Features**
* Native support for encryption at rest
* Fine-grained access control
* SSL support for encrypted connections
* Built-in audit logging capabilities

#### **Data Integrity**:
* ACID compliance
* Strong consistency model
* Native support for UUID, JSONB, and bytea types
* Constraints and triggers for data validation

#### **Performance**:
* Efficient indexing for binary and text data
* Good performance with both read and write operations
* Mature query optimizer
* Support for concurrent access

#### **Operational Benefits**:
* Wide industry adoption
* Extensive tooling ecosystem
* Strong community support
* Well-documented backup and recovery procedures
* Free and open-source

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Simplified architecture with a single source of truth
2. Reliable data persistence and consistency
3. Built-in support for all required data types
4. Easy integration with existing backup and monitoring tools
5. No additional licensing costs

### Negative
1. Limited to PostgreSQL-specific features
2. Team needs to maintain PostgreSQL expertise
3. Single database deployment could be a bottleneck
4. Migration complexity if database change is needed in the future

### Mitigations
1. Use database-agnostic SQL where possible
2. Implement connection pooling
3. Plan for regular maintenance windows
4. Document all PostgreSQL-specific features used

## Implementation Notes
* **SPIKE Nexus** can use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
* All sensitive data will be encrypted before storage
* Regular backups will be configured
* Monitor database performance metrics
* Implement connection pooling for scalability
