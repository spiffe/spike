# ADR-0014: Maintaining SQLite as SPIKE's Primary Storage Backend

<br style="clear:both" />

## Context

SPIKE currently uses SQLite as its backing store for secret management. There 
is a proposal to implement a file-system-based backing store as an alternative 
storage solution. SPIKE uses SPIFFE as its identity control plane for 
authentication and authorization.

The key considerations are:
* SQLite is already implemented and proven to work well for SPIKE's needs
* SQLite itself is fundamentally a file-system-based database
* A new file-system backing store would need to implement similar functionality
* Both solutions ultimately interact with the filesystem at their core

## Decision

We will maintain SQLite as the primary storage backend and not implement a 
separate file-system-based storage solution.

## Rationale

### Technical Advantages of SQLite

1. **File-System Foundation**: SQLite already operates directly on the file 
   system, using efficient file I/O operations. As per SQLite's documentation, 
   it competes directly with `fs.open()` for performance.

2. **ACID Compliance**: SQLite provides built-in:
    * Atomicity for operations
    * Consistency in data storage
    * Isolation for concurrent operations
    * Durability of stored data

3. **Proven Security**: SQLite has undergone extensive security auditing and 
  has a well-understood security model.

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Redundant Development**: Creating a separate file-system store would:
    * Duplicate existing functionality
    * Require implementing concurrent access controls
    * Need additional security auditing
    * Require new testing infrastructure

2. **Maintenance Overhead**: Supporting two storage backends would:
    * Increase maintenance complexity
    * Require maintaining two sets of documentation
    * Complicate troubleshooting
    * Potentially create inconsistencies in behavior

### Performance

* SQLite is highly optimized for the types of operations SPIKE performs
* The overhead of SQLite compared to direct file system operations is 
  negligible for SPIKE's use case
* SQLite's page cache provides performance benefits that would need to be 
  re-implemented in a file-system solution

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Reduced development effort and maintenance burden
2. Continued use of a well-tested, secure storage solution
3. Simplified codebase and deployment
4. Consistent behavior across deployments

### Negative

1. Less flexibility in storage formats
2. Continued dependency on SQLite
3. Potential perception of over-engineering for simple storage needs

### Mitigations

1. Document SQLite's role as a file-system interface
2. Maintain clear interface boundaries for potential future storage implementations
3. Monitor performance and storage requirements to validate continued suitability
