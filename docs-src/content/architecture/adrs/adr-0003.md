# ADR-0003: Root Key Management and Storage Strategy

<br style="clear:both" />

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2024-11-03
- Tags: Security, Storage, Encryption

## Context

We need a secure strategy for managing the root key that **SPIKE Nexus**
uses. This key is critical for the system's security and requires:

- Secure storage
- High availability
- Disaster recovery capabilities
- Protection against unauthorized access
- Balance between security and operational needs

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered approach for root key management:

### 1. Runtime Storage:

* Root key will be stored in memory only as plain text
* This applies to both SPIKE Nexus and SPIKE Keeper components

### 2. Persistent Storage:

* Root key will be stored in a PostgreSQL database
* The stored version will be:
  * Salted
  * Encrypted
  * Protected by admin user's password

## Consequences

### Positive
* Enhanced security through memory-only plain text storage
* Reduced attack surface as the plain text key never touches the disk
* Recovery is possible through encrypted backup in PostgreSQL
* Admin password dependency ensures authorized access only
* Salting provides protection against rainbow table attacks
* Separation of concerns between runtime and persistent storage

### Negative
* Memory-only storage means the key is lost on service restart
* Dependency on admin user's password for recovery
* Need to manage salt generation and storage
* Potential performance impact from encryption/decryption operations
* Risk of key loss if both admin password and memory contents are lost
* Additional complexity in key recovery procedures

## Security Considerations
* Memory must be properly zeroed when the key is no longer needed
* PostgreSQL access must be properly secured
* Admin password strength becomes critical for system security
* Salt management and storage must be handled securely
* Encryption algorithm and key derivation function must be carefully chosen

## Implementation Notes

### 1. Memory Storage:
* Implement secure memory handling
* Use secure string implementations where available

### 2. PostgreSQL Storage:
* Use strong encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256)
* Implement secure key derivation from the admin password
* Ensure proper salt generation and storage
