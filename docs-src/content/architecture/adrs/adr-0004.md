# ADR-0004: SPIKE Keeper Minimalist Design Approach

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2024-11-03
- Tags: Security, Redundancy, Availability

## Context

**SPIKE Keeper** serves as a critical component in our system's key management 
infrastructure, working alongside **SPIKE Nexus**. We need to establish clear 
design principles for **SPIKE Keeper** to ensure it fulfills its role effectively 
and reliably.

Key considerations:
- **SPIKE Keeper** co-exists with **SPIKE Nexus** on the same machine/node
  (*this restriction can be removed if we further secure the communication
  between SPIKE Keeper and SPIKE Nexus with double encryption*)
- It serves as a recovery mechanism for **SPIKE Nexus** crashes
- System reliability is crucial for key management
- Service complexity often correlates with failure rates

## Decision

We will implement **SPIKE Keeper** following a strict minimalist design 
philosophy:

* Core Functionality:
  - Single responsibility: maintain root key in memory
  - No additional features beyond key retention
  - Minimal API surface area

* Implementation Constraints:
  - No optional or "nice-to-have" features
  - No additional endpoints unless absolutely necessary for core function
  - Resist feature creep and scope expansion
  - Avoid unnecessary dependencies

## Consequences

### Positive
- Reduced points of failure
- Easier to maintain and debug
- Lower resource consumption
- Faster startup time
- Simplified testing
- Higher reliability due to reduced complexity
- Clear and focused code base
- Easier security auditing
- Reduced attack surface

### Negative
- May need to reject potentially useful features
- Could require additional services for new functionality
- Might seem limited compared to full-featured alternatives
- May face pressure to add features over time

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization

- Keep codebase small and focused
- Implement only essential error handling
- Minimize external dependencies

### Feature Evaluation Criteria

- Is it essential for key retention?
- Is it required for recovery scenarios?
- Can it be handled by another service?

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize for memory usage
- Keep startup time minimal
- Maintain low CPU footprint

## Monitoring Guidelines

* Focus on essential metrics only:
  - Memory usage
  - Key presence
  - Basic health checks
* Avoid complex monitoring implementations

## References
- 
- Unix philosophy of doing one thing well
- Microservice design principles
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle

## Notes

* Future feature requests should be evaluated against this ADR's principles. 
* Any deviation from the minimalist approach requires strong justification and 
possibly a new ADR.
