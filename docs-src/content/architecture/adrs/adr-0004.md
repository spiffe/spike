# ADR-0004: SPIKE Keeper Minimalist Design Approach

<br style="clear:both" />

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2024-11-03

## Context

**SPIKE Keeper** serves as a critical component in our system's key management 
infrastructure, working alongside **SPIKE Nexus**. We need to establish clear 
design principles for **SPIKE Keeper** to ensure it fulfills its role 
effectively and reliably.

Key considerations:
* **SPIKE Keeper** co-exists with **SPIKE Nexus** on the same machine/node
  (*this restriction can be removed if we further secure the communication
  between SPIKE Keeper and SPIKE Nexus with double encryption*)
* It serves as a recovery mechanism for **SPIKE Nexus** crashes
* System reliability is crucial for key management
* Service complexity often correlates with failure rates

## Decision

We will implement **SPIKE Keeper** following a strict minimalist design 
philosophy:

* Core Functionality:
  * Single responsibility: maintain the root key in memory
  * No additional features beyond key retention
  * Minimal API surface area

* Implementation Constraints:
  * No optional or "nice-to-have" features
  * No additional endpoints unless absolutely necessary for core functionality
  * Resist feature creep and scope expansion
  * Avoid unnecessary dependencies

## Consequences

### Positive

* Reduced points of failure
* Easier to maintain and debug
* Lower resource consumption
* Faster startup time
* Simplified testing
* Higher reliability due to reduced complexity
* Clear and focused code base
* Easier security auditing
* Reduced attack surface

### Negative

* May need to reject potentially useful features
* Could require additional services for new functionality
* Might seem limited compared to full-featured alternatives
* May face pressure to add features over time

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization

* Keep the codebase small and focused
* Implement only essential error handling
* Minimize external dependencies

### Feature Evaluation Criteria

* Is it essential for key retention?
* Is it required for recovery scenarios?
* Can it be handled by another service?

## Performance Considerations

* Optimize for memory usage
* Keep startup time minimal
* Maintain a low CPU footprint

## Monitoring Guidelines

* Focus on essential metrics only:
  * Memory usage
  * Key presence
  * Basic health checks
* Avoid complex monitoring implementations

## References

* Unix philosophy of doing one thing well
* Microservice design principles
* KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle

## Notes

* Future feature requests should be evaluated against this ADR's principles. 
* Any deviation from the minimalist approach requires strong justification and 
possibly a new ADR.
