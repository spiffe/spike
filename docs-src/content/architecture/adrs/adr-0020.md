# ADR-0020: Switch to Zola for Documentation System

## Context

While Docsify has served our documentation needs, we've identified several 
limitations:
* 
* SEO capabilities are limited due to client-side rendering
* Performance is dependent on JavaScript execution
* Template customization options are restricted
* Page load times can be impacted by the single JavaScript parser

We need a documentation system that addresses these limitations while 
maintaining the benefits of our current system.

## Decision

We will switch to [**Zola**][zola] as our documentation system, replacing 
Docsify.

## Rationale

Zola offers several advantages that align better with our current needs:
* Static site generation provides better SEO capabilities
* No JavaScript dependency for core functionality
* Flexible templating system using Tera
* Fast build times due to being written in Rust
* Direct rendering to HTML improves page load performance
* Maintains support for Markdown-based content
* Built-in syntax highlighting and search capabilities

## Consequences

### Positive

* Improved SEO through static HTML generation
* Better performance due to pre-rendered content
* More flexible templating and customization options
* No JavaScript requirement for core functionality
* Faster page loads
* Maintains Git-based workflow
* Syntax highlighting is out of the box
* Built-in search functionality
* Clear separation between content and presentation

### Negative

* Requires a build step (*though builds are **very** fast*)
* Team needs to learn Zola-specific templating syntax
* Migration effort required for existing documentation
* Need to set up a build pipeline for documentation deployment
