## Context

We need a documentation system that:

* Integrates well with our Git workflow
* Supports Markdown formatting
* Requires minimal setup and maintenance effort
* Is easy for developers to contribute to
* Can serve documentation directly from source control

## Decision

We will use **Docsify** as our documentation system.

## Consequences

### Positive

* Git-native: Documentation lives directly in the repository as Markdown files
* Zero build process: Docsify generates documentation on the fly
* Markdown support: Developers can write documentation in familiar Markdown syntax
* Minimal setup: Only requires a single HTML file and basic configuration
* No static HTML files: Documentation is generated on-demand from Markdown
* Easy to maintain: No separate build pipeline or compilation step is needed
* Good search capabilities out of the box
* Support for plugins and themes

### Negative

* Requires JavaScript to be enabled in the browser
* No static HTML generation means reduced SEO capabilities
* Documentation loading might be slightly slower compared to pre-built static sites
* Limited compared to full-featured documentation systems like MkDocs or Sphinx
