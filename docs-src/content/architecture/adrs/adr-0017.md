# ADR-0017: Synchronous Persistence for SPIKE Secrets Store

## Context

**SPIKE** is a Secrets Store that can use an SQLite backing store (*among other
backing store options*) to persist secrets. However, the source of truth for 
the secrets is held in memory. SQLite is primarily used as a backup to rehydrate 
secrets in case the secrets store crashes or needs to be recovered.

Persistence operations were initially designed to be asynchronous, using methods 
like `AsyncSaveSecret()`, to minimize blocking and improve performance. However, 
this design has introduced unnecessary complexity, race conditions, and edge 
cases, with no significant benefit to the overall system. SQLite, being fast and 
lightweight, already offers sufficient performance without the need for 
additional asynchronous operations.

## Problem

The asynchronous approach to persistence introduces the following issues:

* **Increased complexity**: Asynchronous operations, while designed to improve 
  performance, add complexity to the system, making it harder to reason about 
  and troubleshoot.
* **Race conditions and edge cases**: The asynchronous operations have led to 
  potential race conditions, which compromise the system's reliability.
* **Debugging difficulty**: To avoid the race conditions above, we could have 
  used abstractions, including Go channels. However, using Go channels and 
  asynchronous operations creates challenges for debugging, as tracking state 
  transitions becomes non-trivial.

Given that SQLite is already fast enough for our needs, the performance benefit 
of using asynchronous operations is minimal. As a result, we no longer see a 
significant justification for using asynchronous persistence operations in 
this context.

## Decision

* **Synchronous Persistence**: All database persistence operations will now be 
  synchronous.
  * **Justification**: Since SQLite is fast enough, and we are not seeing 
    performance bottlenecks at the database level, the simplicity of synchronous 
    operations outweighs the potential complexity of maintaining asynchronous 
    ones.
  * **Expected Outcome**: This decision reduces the complexity of the codebase, 
    eliminates the potential for race conditions, and makes the system easier 
    to debug and maintain. We will continue to monitor for any performance 
    impact that might arise due to this decision.

* **Fallback to Async if Performance Issues Arise**: In the unlikely event that 
  we observe significant performance issues with synchronous operations, we 
  will consider optimizing specific areas locally.
  * **Optimization Strategy**: If performance degradation is observed, we will 
    explore optimization options such as local caching, batching of persistence 
    operations, or fine-tuning SQLite settings. Asynchronous operations may be 
    reintroduced selectively in these cases.

## Consequences

* **Reduced Complexity**: By removing asynchronous operations, the system will 
  be simpler and easier to maintain, with fewer edge cases and race conditions 
  to handle.
* **Performance Tradeoff**: Synchronous operations may result in slight 
  performance degradation if there is a heavy load on the persistence layer. 
  However, this is unlikely given the current design and SQLite's speed.
* **Easier Debugging**: The synchronous model simplifies debugging, as there are
  no concurrent operations that need to be tracked.

## Alternatives Considered

* **Async Persistence**: We initially considered keeping asynchronous operations 
  to prevent blocking and improve performance. However, this would introduce 
  complexity that isn't justified by the system's current requirements and 
  SQLite's speed.
* **Go Channels for Sync Operations**: Using Go channels to handle 
  synchronization in asynchronous operations was also considered, but it would 
  increase debugging complexity and not address the core issue effectively.

---

This ADR will be revisited if performance issues arise, but for now, the shift 
to synchronous persistence aligns with the goal of simplifying the codebase and 
improving system stability.
