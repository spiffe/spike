# ADR-0012: HTTP Methods for SPIKE API

<br style="clear:both" />

- Status: accepted

## Context

SPIKE is a secrets management system that provides an HTTP API for CRUD 
operations. The system integrates with SPIFFE/SPIRE for identity management 
and authentication. 

When designing the API, we needed to determine how to handle HTTP methods for 
different operations while maintaining security and preventing unwanted 
caching of sensitive data.

Key considerations:
* Prevention of URL caching for security purposes
* Desire for consistent request structure
* Need to maintain semantic clarity of operations
* Integration with proxy servers and security infrastructure
* Auditability and debugging capabilities

## Decision
We will:
1. Use `HTTP POST` method for all API operations (*Create, Read, Update, Delete*)
2. Encode the operation type in the URL query parameter using `action=`
3. Include all operation parameters in the request body

Example URLs:

```
https://host:port/v1/secrets?action=read
https://host:port/v1/secrets?action=delete
https://host:port/v1/secrets?action=write
```

## Consequences

### Positive
* Prevents sensitive data from being cached in URLs
* Avoids sensitive data appearing in server logs
* Provides consistent request structure for all operations
* Simplifies client implementations by using uniform HTTP method
* Makes operation type visible in URL for auditing without exposing sensitive data
* Works well with proxies that might restrict certain HTTP methods
* Maintains clear operation semantics through URL parameters

### Negative
* Deviates from REST architectural principles
* May surprise developers expecting traditional REST endpoints
* Could complicate integration with some REST-focused tools
* URL routing slightly more complex due to query parameter handling

### Neutral
* Operation type moved to query parameter instead of HTTP method
* Need to handle invalid/missing action parameters

## Alternatives Considered

### Traditional REST approach with different HTTP methods

* Rejected due to caching concerns and desire for consistency

### Using path parameters instead of query parameters
   
```
/v1/secrets/read
/v1/secrets/delete
```

- Rejected to maintain existing implementation pattern

### GraphQL-style single endpoint
- 
- Rejected as overly complex for current needs

## Compliance

This decision maintains compliance with security best practices while providing 
a usable API interface. It aligns with the security-first approach required for 
a secrets management system.
