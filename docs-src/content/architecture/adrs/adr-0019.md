# ADR-0019: Plugin-Based Storage Backend Architecture

<br style="clear:both" />

- Status: proposed
- Date: 2024-02-20
- Tags: Persistence, Storage, Plugins, Architecture
- Related: [ADR-0014: Maintaining SQLite as SPIKE's Primary Storage Backend](@/architecture/adrs/adr-0014.md) 

## Context

Following [**ADR-0014**][adr-0014]'s decision to maintain *SQLite* as 
**SPIKE**'s primary storage backend, we recognize the need for flexibility in 
storage solutions for different deployment scenarios. Some deployments 
may require:

* Alternative storage backends for enterprise environments
* Specialized storage solutions for specific use cases
* Custom implementations for unique requirements
* In-memory storage for development and testing

[adr-0014]: @/architecture/adrs/adr-0014.md "ADR-0014"

## Decision

We will implement a plugin-based architecture for storage backends while 
maintaining SQLite as the default implementation. This architecture will:

1. Define a clear storage interface that all backends must implement
2. Provide official plugins for common use cases
3. Enable third-party plugin development
4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing SQLite implementations

## Rationale

### Plugin System Benefits

#### 1. **Extensibility**:
* Users can implement custom storage solutions
* Third-party developers can contribute new backends
* Specialized solutions can be developed without modifying core code

#### 2. **Maintainability**:
* The core codebase remains focused on primary functionality
* Plugins can be maintained independently
* Testing and validation can be scoped to specific implementations

#### 3. **Deployment Flexibility**:
* Different environments can use appropriate storage solutions
* Migration between backends becomes possible
* Development and testing can use simplified implementations

### Official Plugin Scope

#### 1. **Core Implementation**:
* SQLite (default backend, ships with core)
* In-memory (for development and testing)

#### 2. **Additional Official Plugins**:
* PostgreSQL
* S3/MinIO compatible storage

### Interface Requirements

Storage plugins must implement:

#### 1. **Core Operations**:
* CRUD operations for secrets
* Atomic transactions
* Concurrent access handling
* Error handling and recovery

#### 2. **Security Features**:
* Access control integration
* Audit logging support

#### 3. **Management Functions**:
* Health checks
* Backup/restore capabilities
* Migration tools

## Implementation

### Plugin Architecture

Here is a sample structure for the plugin architecture. Note that this is 
a starting point and it will likely be subject to change.

```go
// Interface
type StorageBackend interface {
    // Core operations
    Create(ctx context.Context, secret *Secret) error
    Read(ctx context.Context, id string) (*Secret, error)
    Update(ctx context.Context, secret *Secret) error
    Delete(ctx context.Context, id string) error
    
    // Management
    Initialize(ctx context.Context, config *Config) error
    Healthcheck(ctx context.Context) error
    
    // Transaction support
    BeginTx(ctx context.Context) (Transaction, error)
}

// Registration
type PluginRegistry interface {
    Register(name string, factory StorageFactory) error
    Get(name string) (StorageFactory, error)
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Increased flexibility for different deployment scenarios
2. Clear path for community contributions
3. Simplified testing with in-memory implementation
4. Better separation of concerns

### Negative

1. Additional complexity in plugin management
2. Need for plugin validation and security review
3. Potential for incompatible plugin implementations
4. Documentation overhead for multiple backends

### Mitigations

1. **Plugin Validation**:
  * Provide comprehensive test suites
  * Implement plugin verification tools
  * Document security requirements
1. **Compatibility**:
  * Version plugin interface explicitly
  * Provide migration tools between backends
  * Maintain compatibility tests
1. **Documentation**:
  * Clear plugin development guidelines
  * Example implementations
  * Best practices documentation
