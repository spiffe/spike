# ADR-0005: Use SPIFFE mTLS for Inter-Component Authentication and Communication

<br style="clear:both" />

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2024-11-03

## Context

Our system requires secure communication between various components with:
* Strong mutual authentication
* Network-level security
* Identity management for services
* Automated certificate management
* Zero-trust security model

Current challenges in service-to-service authentication include:
* Managing service identities
* Certificate distribution and renewal
* Secure communication channels
* Identity verification between components

## Decision

We will implement [SPIFFE][spiffe] with mTLS for all inter-component 
communication and authentication:

[spiffe]: https://spiffe.io/

* Authentication Mechanism:
  * Use SPIFFE SVIDs (SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document) for component identification
  * Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for all service-to-service communication

* Identity Management:
  * Each component will be assigned a unique SPIFFE ID
  * Components will authenticate using their SVIDs

* Security Layer:
  * Network security will be handled at the TLS layer using SPIFFE-issued certificates
  * All communication will be encrypted using mTLS

## Consequences

### Positive

* Strong cryptographic identity for each workload
* Automated certificate management
* Zero-trust security model implementation
* Dynamic identity provisioning
* Reduced operational overhead for certificate management
* Platform-agnostic identity management
* Standardized authentication mechanism
* Automatic certificate rotation
* No shared secrets required

### Negative

* Additional system complexity
* Need for SPIFFE infrastructure maintenance
* Performance overhead from TLS handshakes
* Need to manage SPIFFE deployment and updates

## Implementation Requirements

### Infrastructure

* Deploy SPIFFE/SPIRE server
* Configure workload attestation
* Set up certificate authority integration

### Component Integration

* Implement SPIFFE workload API in all components
* Configure mTLS endpoints
* Implement SVID verification

### Security Considerations

* Secure SPIFFE control plane
* Configure proper attestation policies
* Implement certificate rotation policies
* Monitor SVID lifecycle

## Monitoring and Maintenance

* Monitor certificate expiration
* Track authentication failures
* Audit identity assignments
* Monitor SPIFFE infrastructure health

## Recovery Procedures

### Certificate Issues

* Automated SVID renewal
* Manual SVID regeneration procedures
* Fallback authentication methods

### Infrastructure Issues

* SPIFFE server redundancy
* Backup attestation procedures
* Emergency access procedures

## Notes

Regular security audits should verify the correct implementation of SPIFFE/mTLS 
configurations and assess the effectiveness of the authentication mechanisms.
