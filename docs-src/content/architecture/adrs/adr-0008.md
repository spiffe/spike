# ADR-0008: Administrative Access Control System

<br style="clear:both" />

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2024-11-03
- Tags: Security, Administration, Disaster Recovery

## Context

*e need a secure and auditable system for administrative access that:
* Manages initial system provisioning
* Controls ongoing administrative access
* Prevents accidental system re-initialization
* Provides emergency recovery options
- Ensures accountability of administrative actions

## Decision
We will implement a multi-layered administrative access system:

### Initial Provisioning
* Require admin password specification
* Generate admin token in SPIKE Nexus
* Single initialization opportunity

### Ongoing Access:
* Token-based authentication via `spike login`
* Temporary access tokens
* Password-to-token exchange mechanism

### System Protection:
* Prevention of accidental re-initialization
* Out-of-band factory reset capability
* Strict initialization state management

## Consequences

### Positive
* Clear audit trail of administrative actions
* Prevention of accidental system resets
* Temporary token model reduces the risk of token compromise
* Password-based authentication with token exchange provides dual security
* Emergency recovery option available
* Clear separation between normal operation and emergency procedures

### Negative
* Need to manage admin password securely
* Additional complexity in access management
* Potential for system lockout if the password is lost
* Need to secure factory reset capability
* Additional operational overhead for token management

## Implementation Requirements

### Initial Provisioning

#### Password Requirements
* Strong password policies
* Secure password transmission
* Initial token generation rules

#### Initialization Protection
* State tracking mechanism
* Initialization lock
* State persistence

### Authentication Flow

#### Login Process
* `spike login` command implementation
* Password validation
* Token generation and exchange
* Token lifetime management

#### Token Management:
* Token expiration rules
* Token revocation capabilities
* Token usage tracking

### Factory Reset

#### Out-of-band Script:
* Secure script storage
* Access controls
* Execution logging
* State verification

#### Reset Protection:
* Confirmation requirements
* Audit logging
* State validation

## Security Measures

### Access Control

#### Password Protection:
* Secure storage
* Hash algorithms
* Salt management
* Update procedures

#### Token Security:
* Cryptographic strength
* Expiration handling
* Revocation mechanisms
* Usage limitations

### Audit Requirements

#### Logging:
* Login attempts
* Token generations
* Administrative actions
* Reset attempts

#### Audit Trail
* Timestamp recording
* Action attribution
* Success/failure status
* IP address tracking

## Emergency Procedures

### System Reset

#### Prerequisites
* Access to reset script
* Authentication requirements
* Backup verification
* Impact assessment

#### Execution Process:
* Safety checks
* Backup procedures
* Reset execution
* System verification

### Recovery Procedures

#### Access Recovery:
* Password reset process
* Token regeneration
* System state verification
* Access restoration

## Monitoring and Alerts

#### Security Events
* Failed login attempts
* Token misuse
* Initialization attempts
* Reset attempts

#### System State
* Initialization status
* Token validity
* System integrity
* Access patterns

## Implementation Guidelines

### Command Line Interface

```bash
spike login --password [password]  # Exchange password for temporary token
spike reset --force              
# Execute factory reset (requires additional safeguards)
# for example it will print a script but not execute it.
```

### State Management
* Use atomic operations for state changes
* Implement state persistence
* Include state verification
* Maintain state history

* [OWASP Authentication Guidelines](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)
* [NIST Digital Identity Guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/)

## Notes
* Regular testing of reset procedures is required
* Document all emergency procedures
* Train administrators on proper usage
* Regular audit of access patterns
* Review and update procedures periodically

## Warning

The factory reset capability should be strictly controlled and documented. 
Accidental execution could result in complete system reset and data loss.
