# ADR-0021: SPIKE Keeper as a Stateless Shard Holder

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2025-03-01
- Tags: Stateless, Availability, Resilience, Fault-Tolerance

## Context

**SPIKE Nexus** is the core secret store that generates and manages the 
**root encryption key**. To ensure availability and resilience, the **root key** 
is sharded using **Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme** and distributed to multiple 
**SPIKE Keeper** instances. These **SPIKE Keeper**s are responsible for holding 
their respective key shards **in memory** to support the recovery process in 
case **SPIKE Nexus** needs to reconstruct its **root key**.

A key design principle in **SPIKE** is **simplicity** and **minimalism**:
The **SPIKE Keeper** component should remain as lightweight as possible, 
avoiding unnecessary complexity such as awareness of Nexus, complex 
configuration, or inter-Keeper communication. Instead, **SPIKE Nexus** should 
maintain full control over key management while leveraging **SPIKE Keeper**s 
as dumb storage units for key shards.

## Decision

**SPIKE Keeper**s remain stateless and unaware of **SPIKE Nexus**:

* **SPIKE Keeper**s do not need to know which **SPIKE Nexus** instance they are 
  serving.
* They store their assigned key shard **in-memory** and do not persist in any 
  state.

**Zero configuration for SPIKE Keepers**:

* **SPIKE Keeper**s have no static configuration files or runtime parameters 
  related to **SPIKE Nexus**.
* Deployment should be as simple as running a **SPIKE Keeper** instance without 
  additional setup.

**SPIKE Nexus is responsible for lifecycle management**:

* **SPIKE Nexus** generates the root key, sharding it and distributing the 
  pieces to **SPIKE Keeper**s.
* **SPIKE Nexus** polls Keepers to check their health and ensure that a quorum 
  is available.
* If a **SPIKE Keeper** goes down and restarts, **SPIKE Nexus** is responsible 
  for rehydrating it with the correct key shard.

**Polling-based health monitoring and rehydration**:

* **SPIKE Keeper**s *do not* initiate communication with **SPIKE Nexus**.
  * Instead, **SPIKE Nexus** periodically queries **SPIKE Keeper**s for their 
    status.
* If a **SPIKE Keeper** is found to be empty (*e.g., after a restart*), 
  **SPIKE Nexus** reassigns the missing shard.

## Rationale

* **Security**: **SPIKE Keeper**s hold only a single shard, which is not 
  adequate to regenerate the root key. They are never aware of other 
  **SPIKE Keeper**s or the full key. This limits their attack surface.
* **Simplicity**: By eliminating configuration and inter-service dependencies, 
  **SPIKE Keeper**s become easy to deploy, replace, and scale.
* **Availability**: The polling and rehydration mechanism ensures that 
  *SPIKE Nexus** can automatically recover lost shards without manual
  intervention.
* **Fault Tolerance**: Stateless **SPIKE Keeper**s can be replaced without 
  requiring reconfiguration or coordination with other components.

## Consequences

### Positive

* Simplifies Keeper deployment and operation.
* Improves security by ensuring Keepers never hold full knowledge of the system.
* Enhances reliability by making Keepers easily replaceable without system-wide 
  impact.
* Reduces operational burden since **SPIKE Nexus** automatically manages the 
  lifecycle of **SPIKE Keeper**s and their shards.

### Negative

* **SPIKE Nexus** must handle additional logic for polling, health monitoring, 
  and rehydration.
* **SPIKE Keeper**s depend on **SPIKE Nexus** for their purpose, making them 
  entirely reliant on **SPIKE Nexus**' availability.

## Alternatives Considered

### SPIKE Keepers as Stateful Services:

* Rejected because it adds complexity and requires persistent storage.
* Would introduce additional configuration and synchronization challenges.

### SPIKE Keepers Managing Their Own Shards:

* Rejected as it violates the principle of keeping **SPIKE Keeper**s unaware
  of the full system state.
* Would require **SPIKE Keepers** to store metadata about **SPIKE Nexus**, 
  increasing complexity and risk.

### Push-Based Shard Distribution Instead of Polling:

* Rejected because it would require **SPIKE Keeper**s to maintain knowledge of 
  **SPIKE Nexus**.
* Polling ensures that **SPIKE Keeper**s can remain stateless and unaware of 
  the system topology.

## Decision Outcome

This decision is final unless significant operational issues arise. Future 
revisions may consider optimizations such as event-driven polling or alternative 
**SPIKE Keeper** designs if the current model proves inefficient at scale.
