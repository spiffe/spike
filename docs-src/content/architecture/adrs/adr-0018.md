# ADR-0018: Administrative Access to SPIKE

<br style="clear:both" />

## Context

**SPIKE** requires a robust and secure administrative access model to balance 
operational flexibility, security, and auditability. To achieve this, 
**SPIKE** defines three predefined roles for emergency Disaster Recovery (*DR*) 
and superadmin access, while delegating named administrative access to an 
external identity management system.

## Decision

### Role-Based Administrative Access

Administrative access in SPIKE is granted using specific SPIFFE IDs:

*`spiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/superuser` - **Super Admin**: 
  Can perform all administrative tasks **except** recovery or restore operations.
*`spiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/recover` - **Recovery User**: 
  Can **only** recover the root key shards to the local file system.
*`spiffe://$trustRoot/spike/pilot/role/restore` - **Restore User**: 
 Can **only** restore the root key by providing one shard at a time.

This role separation ensures that:

* Different users can have distinct operational responsibilities. For example, 
  an operator responsible for system restoration cannot modify access policies 
  for secrets.
* The separation enhances auditability, allowing clear tracking of actions 
  taken by different roles.

* Additionally:

* Once the system is initialized, accidental re-initialization is prevented.
* In emergencies, an out-of-band script can be used to perform a 
  **factory reset** of **SPIKE**.

### Multi-Admin Support via External Identity Management

Beyond the three predefined roles (*superuser, recover, restore*), named admin 
access to **SPIKE** will be managed through an external identity provider, such 
as an OIDC (*OpenID Connect*) provider.

Here's the reasoning:

* **SPIKE** focuses on secure and efficient secret storage, not authentication.
* Access control and identity management are better delegated to established 
  identity standards like OIDC.
* This approach ensures compatibility with enterprise authentication policies 
  and simplifies integration with existing IAM solutions.

## Consequences

* **Security**: The predefined SPIFFE-based roles provide a minimal attack 
  surface for core administrative functions, while OIDC integration ensures 
  scalability and proper identity management.
* **Auditability**: Separation of concerns ensures that different roles have 
  clearly defined privileges, improving traceability and compliance.
* **Flexibility**: Organizations can define additional admin roles through 
  their preferred external identity provider without modifying **SPIKE**'s core
  architecture.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Fully SPIFFE-Based Admin Management**
    - Rejected due to scalability concerns. Managing multiple administrators 
     directly within **SPIKE** would introduce unnecessary complexity.
2. **No Role Separation**
    - Rejected for security and compliance reasons. A single admin role would 
      lack the necessary granularity for controlled recovery and restore operations.
