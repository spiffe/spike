# ADR-0015: Use Singular Form for File and Package Naming

<br style="clear:both" />

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2024-11-18
- Tags: Convention, Naming, Go

## Context

Our codebase needs consistent naming conventions for Go files and packages. 
While Go has a strict convention for package names (singular), file naming is 
less standardized. This inconsistency can lead to maintenance overhead and 
cognitive load when working with the codebase.

## Decision

We will use **singular form** for both file names and package names unless 
using a plural form provides clear additional clarity or disambiguation.

Examples:
* `entity.go` over `entities.go`
* `user.go` over `users.go`
* `config.go` over `configs.go`

Exceptions are allowed when:

* Plural form better represents the file's contents (e.g., `constants.go` for a 
  file containing only constants)
* Disambiguation is needed (e.g., `users_api.go` vs `user_model.go`)

## Consequences

### Positive

* Consistent with Go's package naming convention
* Reduces decision overhead
* Easier maintenance and navigation
* Aligns with Go standard library practices

### Negative

* May require renaming existing files
* Some edge cases may require team discussion
