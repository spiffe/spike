# ADR-0016: Memory-First Secrets Store

<br style="clear:both" />

## Context

**SPIKE** keeps secrets in the memory of **SPIKE Nexus** by design. The secrets
are encrypted and backed up to a secondary backup storage; however, the primary
source of truth is the in-memory store.

This is an efficient mechanism to store application secrets (*e.g., 
API keys, certificates, even relatively beefy Kubeconfig files*). 

However, we need to maintain certain requirements for **SPIKE** to be a 
production-grade secure, reliable, and robust secrets store:

Our requirements include:

* **High-Performance Access**: Secrets should be rapidly retrievable with 
  minimal latency.
* **Robust Backup and Recovery**: The system should persist data safely and 
  recover quickly from crashes.
* **Security**: Restrict access to secrets via path-based policies and protect 
  data at rest via encryption.
* **Auditability**: Record all read/write operations for compliance and 
  monitoring.
* **Scalability**: The system should handle up to hundreds of thousands of 
  secrets.
* **High Availability**: Provide read replicas for scaling reads and failover 
  strategies.

We considered **disk-only**, **disk-first**, **cloud-storage-only** 
(like *AWS S3*) and **cloud-storage-first** solutions and decided a memory-first
secrets store with a reliable back-up mechanism is the best fit for **SPIKE**.

## Decision
   
**SPIKE** will be an in-memory secrets store with the following characteristics:

* **In-Memory Data**: The primary data store resides in RAM, offering 
  **near-instant reads and writes**.
* **Periodic Backup**: An encrypted backing store (SQLite, Postgres DB, or an
  S3-compatible interface) will serve as a backup. The system uses exponential 
  retries to ensure data persistence.
* **Hardened Container**: The service is recommended to run in a hardened 
  container or sandbox with minimal OS surface area, reducing the likelihood of 
  root compromise.
* **Path-Based Access Controls**: Secrets are organized hierarchically
  (*for, e.g., `/secrets/acme/*`*). Only specific roles/tokens can access their 
  respective paths.
* **Replication**: A primary read-write store with read-only replicas. These 
  replicas can be promoted or re-hydrated if the primary fails.
* **Auditing**: All secret operations (*reads, writes, deletes*) are logged to 
  an audit trail for compliance and investigation.

## Rationale

* **Performance**: In-memory data reduces latency compared to purely 
  disk-backed solutions.
* **Backup Safety**: The secondary backup (*encrypted at rest*) mitigates memory 
  volatility by allowing the system to recover from unexpected crashes or 
  restarts.
* **Security**:
  * **Hardened Container**: Minimizes OS-level attack surface.
  * **Encryption at Rest**: Protects offline backups if the disk is compromised.
  * **Path-Based Policies**: Enforces the principle of least privilege.
  * **Auditing**: Aids in compliance and detection of unauthorized access.
  * **Scalability**: Storing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of secrets 
    in memory is feasible with proper resource planning.

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

* **Performance Gain**: Ultra-fast secrets retrieval for latency-sensitive 
  applications.
* **Backup Resilience**: Encrypted disk backups reduce permanent data loss 
  if the container restarts.
* **Fine-Grained Control***: Path-based policies and an internal auditing 
  mechanism meet security and compliance needs.
  
## Trade-Offs and Risks

In contrast to our decision, here are some benefits of using a database (*or a 
remote object storage*) as the single source of truth:

* *Security and Persistence*: Using an encrypted database as the source of truth 
  ensures that secrets are securely stored and persist across system restarts 
  or crashes. Though with frequent forced writes, the risk of data loss is
  minimized and can further be mitigated by using mechanisms like message queues.
* *Scalability*: Databases can handle growth more effectively, allowing
  the system to accommodate the increasing number of secrets without a 
  significant redesign. Again, this is a non-issue because if you have to store 
  millions of secrets, then you need to review your architecture anyway. In an 
  ideal world, the only secret an app needs are PKI certificates (like SVIDs) as 
  they can uniquely identify the app.
* *Simplicity*: A single source of truth simplifies the architecture, making 
  the system easier to develop and maintain. To counter this, SPIKE Nexus'
  current architecture is simple enough to maintain and develop. We have
  abstracted exponential backoff and retry mechanisms to the storage layer, and
  once we have adequate abstractions, the maintainability of the system will
  be equivalent to a database-as-the-single-source-of-truth system. Besides,
  at the cost of simplicity, we lose performance and will have to implement 
  additional caching mechanisms to mitigate latency, which will add complexity
  and result in an equally complex system. There is no free lunch.

Here are some other liabilities of a memory-first secrets store:

* **Crash Consistency**: Potential for a small window of data loss if the system 
  crashes just before backup. 
  * **Mitigation**: frequent or near-synchronous write-through.
* **Failover Complexity**: Replication and promotion logic must be robustly 
  implemented to handle node failures seamlessly.
* **Memory as an Additional Attack Surface**:
  * While ephemeral in-memory storage can mitigate certain disk-theft scenarios, 
    memory itself can be inspected if an attacker gains OS-level access.
  * That's why hardening the container and ensuring proper access controls are 
    crucial. **SPIKE** assume the machine as the trusted boundary. So, if the
    machine is compromised, the secrets are considered compromised as well.
