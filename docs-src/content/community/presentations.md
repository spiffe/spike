# Presentations and Demos

Here you can find a range of presentations and demos that highlight **SPIKE**'s
capabilities and showcase its innovative features.

* [Introduction to SPIKE: Secure Production Identity for Key Encryption][spike]:<br>
  This is our first **SPIKE** walkthrough, where we introduce the project and its
  goals.
* [Unlocking SPIKE: A New Era for Secure Identity-Driven Secrets][spike-intro]:<br>
  This is a brief introduction to **SPIKE**; what it is, how it works, and why
  it's important.
* [Unlocking SPIKE: A Seamless Token-Based Login Experience][spike-jwt]:<br>
  In this demo, we see **SPIKE**'s new JWT authentication flow.
* [Goodbye Passwords: Secure Secrets Management with SPIFFE
  and SPIKE][spike-passwordless]:<br>
  In this demo, we allow a user to use `spike` just by checking an SVID; we don't
  use any kind of passwords to identify the user, SPIFFE does it for us.
* [Unveiling SPIKE's New Audit Trail Capabilities: Zero-Trust Meets
  Accountability][spike-audits]:<br>
  This demo explains the new auditing capabilities of **SPIKE** that we will
  continue developing. This is the initial incarnation of the feature and
  more will come.
* [Introducing Policy-Based Access Control in SPIKE][spike-policy]:<br>
  This demo introduces the new policy-based access control feature of **SPIKE**.
  This is the initial incarnation of the feature. We will create more demos
  as we enhance the feature.
* [Policy to the Rescue: Secure Secret Access and Metadata with
  SPIKE][spike-metadata]:<br>
  This demo introduces the new **SPIKE** metadata API. We also use the **SPIKE**
  Go SDK to consume secrets.
* [Using Policies to Read and Write Secrets using SPIKE][spike-policies]:<br>
  This demo introduces the new **Makefile**-based development workflow, the
  enhanced starter script, policy-based access control, and metadata support.
* [Secrets Resiliency with SPIKE: Self-Healing and Doomsday Recovery][spike-doomsday]:<br>
  Secrets management is critical, but what happens when everything fails? In 
  this video, we explore **SPIKE**’s disaster recovery mechanisms, covering both 
  self-healing capabilities and the manual break-the-glass recovery process.
* [Federating Secrets with SPIFFE and SPIKE][spike-federated]<br>
  In this demo, we show how you can deploy **SPIRE** and **SPIKE** from SPIFFE
  Helm charts. We then establish a multi-cluster secret federation where 
  the workload clusters can securely access secrets stored in the management
  cluster.
