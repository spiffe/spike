# Get in Touch

Hi üëã ---Thank you for wanting to contact us ‚ù§Ô∏è.

This page outlines the various ways you can touch base.

## SPIFFE Slack Workspace

The [**SPIFFE** Slack Workspace](https://slack.spiffe.io/) is one of the best
ways to get in touch with the community. 

You can use the [**SPIFFE** Slack Workspace](https://slack.spiffe.io/) ask 
questions, get help, and share ideas, comments, and suggestions with the
community.

If you have a question, issue with your development environment, a feature 
request, or a bug report, it'll be great if you could [initiate the 
discussion on **Slack**](https://slack.spiffe.io/).

## Email

You can also reach out to us on via email, sending an email to
[team@spike.ist](mailto:team@spike.ist).

## GitHub Issues

Additionally, you can [create a **GitHub**
issue](https://github.com/spiffe/spike/issues/new); however, we recommend
using the [**SPIFFE** Slack Workspace](https://slack.spiffe.io) to initiate
a discussion first, before creating an issue.
