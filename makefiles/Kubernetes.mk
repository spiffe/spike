# 4. Forward registry.
docker-forward-registry:
	./hack/k8s/minikube-forward-registry.sh

# For Minikube, instead of forwarding the registry, you can directly load
# the container images to the cluster's internal local registry.
#
# This is especially helpful when you are using Docker Desktop for Windows' WSL
# Integration and `make docker-push` hangs up regardless of the
# `insecure-registries` settings in `Settings > Docker Engine` of Docker
# for Windows or `/etc/docker/daemon.json` of Docker on WSL.
#
# This can happen because in a typical WSL-Docker-for-Windows integration,
# your Docker CLI is in WSL, but the daemon is Docker Desktop: So when you run
# `docker push localhost:5000/...`, the Windows-side daemon tries to reach
# Windows' `localhost:5000`; meanwhile your WSL `docker push` will hit WSL's
# `localhost:5000` (*where you likely did the `kubectl port-forward`). Those
# are different network stacks. The result will: the push sits on "Waiting".
